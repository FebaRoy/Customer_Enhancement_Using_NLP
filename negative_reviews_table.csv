"Nothing fancy, just decent quality and simple installation.  As may have been mentioned, one must discard the provided Phillips screws that the manufacturer provides to affix the bracket to the wall stud.  Use your own.  The TV I mounted with it is an older flat-panel, so it's a little heavier than the news ones.  This thing isn't fazed, and stays where I put it.",0,Negative
"Don't have anything to really complain about.  EXCEPT there doesn't seem to be a way, or i'm missing it to tilt the TV up or down (ie. mounted high on the wall and pointed down towards the chair).  and i am quite savvy with tools/assembly/etc. And it is difficult to get to the bolt heads on the back of the TV to adjust the angle.  No reason to not buy it though.",0,Negative
"I wasn't willing to pay $100 for simply mounting a TV, so I bought this item to give it a shot. I have no real complaints.  It holds the TV up, which is all I wanted.  It does not have smooth pivot points, so if you're planning on moving it around a lot, don't use this one, but if it's going to stay in a static area, this is your mount.",2,Negative
"I had to use a hacksaw to cut away part of this to hang my 24&#34; LED TV in my bedroom. Other than that, seems to work fine.",3,Negative
"This was perfect for my 24"" LED monitor, I had it up in just a few mins and with no problems.  It included a small bubble level and it also came with a 6' HDMI cable which I was not expecting.",4,Negative
"Pro's: Easy to setup.  Supports many different VESA formats. Has some articulation.  Sturdy construction.  Can be installed by one person w/o too much effort.Con's: Cable guides fall off easily.  The joints are a bit too stiff; you really have to man-handle it to get it fully extended, and you have to push fairly hard to get it to compact again.  So far I have not noticed any wear from this firm pulling/pushing, but I worry because it is only attached to the studs buy 2 bolts.",2,Negative
"It took about 10 mins to install this TV Wall Mount with a 48 inch Samsung TV.  It does the job, there are much more expensive arms, but this does the trick.",4,Negative
you can't beat the price and the installation was simple as can be. We installed it in our office and it is perfect! no problems and was completed in a matter of minutes,4,Negative
"you can spend a ton of money on one of these, or you can buy this one.  hung a 32 inch tv with it with no problems.",4,Negative
This device is somewhat weak even for the 46 inch TV weighing only 31lbs that I'm using it with. after some adjusting it's working ok.,0,Negative
Very concerned over hanging a 46&#34; tv on the wall.  Got this mount due to low price.  Very impressed.  No doubt it will handle a 30# TV.  Allows full 90 degree rotation with 21&#34; from wall to centerline at maximum extension.,2,Negative
Another gem hidden amoungst the Amazon halls. This works well for my LED tv's. I used the heavy duty mount bolts for mounting my tv on the back porch. I hung on the sucker and it's not coming down. And I'm 190lbs!,1,Negative
"Too Heavy and Poor weld quality .Lot of blow holes in welding, though painting was made nice to cover it or else it was made with inefficient welder. I think this is is not well designed by experts. Hope no calculations are involved in making it. Just copied the shape forms some other manufacturer.",3,Negative
"Used this for a Panasonic 32"" LCD TV.  Mount works fine, instructions were minimal.  I was able to use the supplied hardware to attach the TV and to attach the mount to the wall.  I did have a problem hanging the TV, per the instructions you have to mount the unit and now attach the TV, this was not very easy so I removed the mounting plate at the pivor point and took it off the wall mount, mounted this on the TV and now re-attached to the TV mount, this was a lot easier.",2,Negative
"It is a solid mount and I doubt that it will ever fail to hold the 22"" LED TV that is mounted on it.  My only complaint is that the bolt that attaches the arm to the wall plate is smaller then the hole in the wall plate so when the TV is anything other than parallel to the wall it leans (up to 1.25"" from one side of the TV to the other ~16"") but for the price I can live with that.",2,Negative
"I consider myself to be a good DIYer. I've installed mounts for my 2 Samsung 46"" and 55"" LED TVs with no problems for 5 years. So, for this VideSecu mount, inspite of poor installation instructions, I carfeully measured all domensions to fit my new 32"" Samsung LED SmartTV in a limited kitchen space. My mistake was, based on the diagrams, I assumed that the length of both the swinging arms of the mount (the single and the double arms) were of the same length. What a disaster! After installing the mount when I mounted the TV and folded the arms the TV did not center itself to the wall side of the mount! It was then that I noticed the inner length of the 2 arms is about 4"" longer than the outer single arm. In other words once the arms on the mount were fully folded in towards the wall my TV was not centered in the limited space that I had and looked awful. I don't know why the manufacturer did not keep both arms the same length. At least they shd have mentioned it in the instructions.This to me is a major product defect. Luckily with Amazon I was able to return this mount but had to pay return S&H;.",2,Negative
We needed something to Extend our tv away from the hot pipe for the winter and this wall mount did the trick. It went up with no a problems. It worked out very well!,3,Negative
"its a little flimsy and not the easiest to put together, for the price it works.  But for the quality i'd go with Cheetah.",4,Negative
It works for the tv I bought but I had to use some of my own washers for the screws.  I thought it would have everything.,4,Negative
The directions stink. Just remember the spacers go under the arms if you have to use them and you will be ok.,2,Negative
"Easy to install, with extra hardware for installing your TV. However, my TV had a curved back, so I used the included spacers to space the bars on the back of the TV. I was skeptical of the two lag bolts attaching the bracket to the stud under the drywall, so I added two 5/16&#34; lags, under washers holding the inside edges of the mounting brackets.After installing the Swing Arm wall mount, I grabbed the end of the bracket, fully extended. The bracket didn't sag a bit. I concluded that the supplied two lag bolts would have been sufficient.I've swung my TV out and exercised the various angles available, and found the swing arm not giving a millimeter.I fully recommend this wall mount. I've a few other VideoSecu mounting brackets for wall mounted and floor stand speakers and one for an 80-inch Sharp TV. All are quality products.",2,Negative
"This is the second VideoSecu product I have ordered. They are rock-solid, and with the range of fasteners and extra hardware they include in the package, it's hard to imagine any speaker or TV that these systems won't fit.",2,Negative
"This mount is sturdy, easy to install, and easy to mount the TV to.  The included hardware was heavy duty also.  The action is good, and tension is adjustable.  The tilt can be adjusted by using the knob in lieu of one of the bolts, or locked in place (which makes it more difficult for someone to remove the TV unless they have a wrench with).  I mounted the 27"" TV on our lanai, so a little theft-proofing is a good thing.  The TV is now visible either on the lanai, or from the patio.I RECENTLY BOUGHT A SECOND ONE, AND THEY HAVE CHANGED.  STILL STURDY, BUT LACKING THE QUICK MOUNT FEATURE! NOW YOU MUST HOLD THE TV IN PLACE WHILE INSERTING THE TINY SCREWS THROUGH THE BACK.",0,Negative
"Do not listen to other reviewers, screws that this came with are concrete only, there are no wood or dry wall screws. You will!!!! need a stud finder!!! There are 8 holes in total on a mounting plate, so it is plenty enough if you hit the center of a stud. Sturdy,good looking. There is a whole set of machine screws for(my guess)all TV types plus couple of tools that you will need.",1,Negative
I have this wall mount installed outside. I have a 32&#34; hanging on it in my backyard. Easy to install and have had no problems what so ever..,0,Negative
"received the product and got it installed today. for the most part I am pretty happy with the hardware except the materials being used to make screws or other parts. the screws get very easily damaged by the most commonly used screw drivers that you can find for $1 per piece.  Once I put the bolt into the LCD TV and mount it with the plate, I found myself having a hardtime removing the screw because the tread mark on the screw head is already messed by by the screw driver, which makes me doubt about the material being used on the mount and arms.  is the material used on the mount going to deliver the same quality as the bolts and nuts?",0,Negative
shipping was fast.. Item came as advertised.. Although I haven't used the mounts I got what I paid for and fast... No complaints.,4,Negative
I have these brackets also and they do not stick up above the speaker as one reviewer has stated.  If you read and follow the directions included with them then they will not stick up above your speakers.  I installed them myself and they are somewhere around the middle of the speaker in the back.  There is no way in the world that you can say that they stick up above the speaker unless you did not follow the included directions.,2,Negative
"Mount very sturdy, and no worries about maintaining television weight. Installation may have been easier if the instructions were included.Great mount, sturdiest I have seen.",2,Negative
"I have had this product about a month and used it to mount a Philips 32"" TV.  This is the first time I have ever mounted a TV so I was a little apprehensive.  The actual mounting of the arm to the wall took about 15 minutes.  The most difficult part was attaching the TV to the arm.  It takes two people and the screws tended to get cross-threaded fairly easily, I blame the Philips TV more than the arm mount for this fact.  Since installation the mount has been stable and I no longer worry about my inexperience resulting in the TV falling off the wall.  One thing I learned is that the wall I mounted it on was thinner than the rest of the walls in my house so the lag bolts went right through the wall.  Luckily only a closet was on the opposite side.  The instructions are good and I believe that anyone with a little bit of home improvement saavy could handle this task.",0,Negative
"It was actually easy to install EXCEPT for the fact screws snap.  When you get to the last 1/4"" of screw the bolts into the wall be very careful the can weaking and snap.  Do you want your expense tv hanging on these cheap screws.... I don't think so.  I went to Orchard Hardware and bought new screws after two snapped in off in the wall.  Before you ask did I drill pilot holes... ah yes... I followed directions to a t.  Which I have say are very goofy looking directions. Do I feel I tightened the screws to tight... not really since I still had a washer moving around.  Just cheap quality.  We are relying on our tv staying put not hitting the floor because of cheap screws.",0,Negative
"The installation was straight-forward.  Other reviewers said they needed to purchase longer screws to attach the mount to the Sony LCD TV.  I used the M6 screws provided by Sanus.  The screws are 12 mm long.  The Sony owners manual says that screws need to be ""8 mm to 12 mm in length when measured from the attaching surface of the mounting hook"".  The bracket, nut, and locknut are about 3 mm, so the 12 mm screw is within specification.  I liked that Sanus supplies lag bolts to attach the bracket to the wall.  Lag bolts are much easier to screw into the wall than the screws supplied with another wall mount we installed.",0,Negative
"I used this to put a heavy 42"" Plasma TV onto an Ikea TV stand.  It took over an hour, but I could easily do it myself.  It came with lots of different sized screws for various TV sets and tilting the bottom of the TV to reach the cables is doable (in short, I was able to do it, but still avoid doing it again).",0,Negative
"Over a year, and it's still holding my 46 inch G25, couldn't be happier with this purchase. It is very durable and mobile, couldn't be happier!",4,Negative
"Works for what it needed to.  Only hung a 32&#34; tv in the basement, so I'm not sure how it holds up with bigger TVs.",4,Negative
"Used this to mount my 52"" Sony LCD. Talk about easy!. Once you mount the bracket to the wall and the mounts to the TV, you simply lift the TV to the bracket, hang by the hooks, center and tighten the set screws. The only difficult part was the weight of the TV.  Highly recommended.",0,Negative
"This mount is too small for anythng bigger than 46"".  Plus, if you have a thin LED TV from Samsung, etc., you would want to buy a low profile mount.  This mount is too ""thick"".",2,Negative
"I needed a mount to put a 50"" HDTV over my fireplace in a home we recently purchased; this home is 75-years old and the walls are all plaster with brick on the other side.I had minimal experience with plaster prior to this so I was very nervous about how well this would hold up; the only experience I did have was in hanging pictures which I found to be an incredibly painful process.It took more effort than we expected to mount it, predominantly because my drill bits wouldn't go through the plaster, so I had to purchase masonry drill bits to get through the plaster and then a bit into the brick behind it.  Because we didn't have any studs to go into the way we would with a regular drywall, we used the extra parts that came with the mount to give extra stability (I don't remember the name for the parts, but essentially a metal tube that sit inside the holes we drilled, and then the bolts for the mount went into these tubes).Really once we realized we needed new drill bits the rest of the installation was dead simple.  The mount is incredibly sturdy and has absolutely no give whatsoever, and holds the TV without any difficulty.  I had to remove the TV and put it back on the mount while painting the walls recently, and the mount still has had no issues.There is not much space between the wall/mount and the TV so you definitely need to plug in all wires before placing the TV on the mount, otherwise it will be almost impossible to plug things in later.  The tilt mechanism works very well; my only complaint is I don't see a way to lock the TV into place (the tile or the horizontal position) the way I expect it should.  It isn't really much of an issue since it never moves without being pushed, so short of the whole mount coming off the wall or an earthquake I think it will be fine.------Update 6/30Well we actually did have a small earthquake in StL not that long ago and the TV is just as secure as it was before.  The earthquake wasn't strong enough to destroy any buildings here so it wasn't a huge test, but it is nice to know that after my previous comment (see my last sentence above this paragraph) that it didn't come loose at all.",0,Negative
We bought this mount with a Samsung 52B750 LCD TV.  It is very sturdy mount with a well appointed hardware package for many different TV's and wall types.  My only complaints are that you can't operate the tilt feature when the TV is mounted on it as you can't reach the knobs to loosen it and it is made in China.,4,Negative
"Well I have bought many many thing from amazon.com, but have never left a review. I am choosing to do so with this product because of the quality of the materials and the price.I bought this Sanus TV mount to mount my 55"" Samsung LED TV. 7100 series. Was a little worried at first about the product not fitting my TV since it only goes up to 56"", but had no issues. all I can say is measure twice and drill once and make sure it is level. took about 75 minutes to install and is solid as a rock.Some people have had problems with the head of the lag bolts breaking off, but I had no issues. As the instructions say ""do not over tighten the lag bolts""I can not rave enough about this TV mount it is made with very thick gage steel and quality parts.Save your money.. I almost spent $250 on a slim mount for my tv. got this mount for $49 and its better quality.",0,Negative
"This is a sturdy well made bracket. My main problem with this bracket is adjusting the tilt. The nobs for the adjusting are virtually unreachable once the TV is on the wall if you have a 52"" TV. To get your arm behind it and to tighten the nobs once its on the wall impossible. I could only reach one side and overtime it gets lose and I have to stretch behind and tighten it again. The other nob is way to far inside on the opposite side to even reach. Also, installing and tightening the locking screws for the rack if the TV is tilting downward virtually impossible. Note. the placement of the cables on the backside of the TV will also limit the angle of tilt you can achieve (unless you cut out a hole in the wall for them. Bottom line: very limited tilt angle available depending on the application.",0,Negative
"As mentioned by the other reviewer, this mount's instruction is very confusing.  Beware of the drill hole mismatch as mentioned.  Go with the 1/4"" drill bit when drilling the mounting screw guiding holes.The lettering on the screws are definately messed up!  However, you are only going to use one set of the screws (4 of them).  Those will be the set that will fit into your mounting holes on your Plasma or LCD TV.  I used a screw driver as a guage on how wide and deep the mounting holes are on my Plasma TV and then measure that against the sets of provided screws.  I round up using the largest set(I think it is H) with the 4 square washers and the 2 TV mounts for my TH42PA25U Panasonic Plasma TV.As far as the other provided screws and materials, I used the large anchor type screws (4 of them, you can not mistaken them, the biggest of all screws provided) for the studs on the wall and the washers(4 of them), which are right next to the anchor screws.  It mentioned not to use the plastic anchors for drywalls.  So make sure you find the middle of your studs before you start ratcheting in your anchor screws.I am not sure if I need to use the spacers (1 and 2), which are mislabeled BTW.  But they do have the ""1"" and ""2"" on them if you look carefully.  I did not have to use my extension brackets so I can not say how easy or hard to install them.READ THE INSTRUCTION OVER TWICE before you start! and Good Luck..",0,Negative
"I bought this mount for my 42"" inch Vizio Plasma tv.Well first you use a stud finder and find the dead center of the stud.Then drill with 1/4 drill bit a starter hole.Have someone hold up the mount and use a ratchet to screw in the 3/8 in bolts and then you just have to hook the adapter rails to the tv and lift the tv it hooks on the rails on the mount.Once you take the bottom stand of the tv it losses 10 ponds of weight",0,Negative
"What more can I say, they are screws. Very strong, they screw into my 120mm fans with no problem; even though they didn't have grooves. I guess the plastic on the fans is weak enough to take the screws. Very happy with these. Received next day with Amazon Prime.",0,Negative
All I can really say is that they are what they appear to be and work as advertised.  They seem to be a high-quality product and I ran into no problems with them.,4,Negative
"Drilling through the brick wasn't that much fun, but once it was up, its worked nicely.  Currently have a 20"" on it.  Might be a little scary with a heavier 27"".",0,Negative
"First, this is a great metal mount, good mic stand adapter, rubber feet... well they need some epoxy to stay in the mount solid.Here is the failure from line 6...  and from their website....POD Feet Kit  Product Code: 98-030-0009  Basically the rubber feet kit because they know they screwed up and unless the rubber feet are epoxied in to cement them in on the mount, they will find a way to wiggle out of the mount and get lost.Failure #2,  6/32 sheetmetal screws ....  not included to screw mount the center rear portion of the pod to the metal mount.This would have cost line 6 all of but  $1 to $2 total cost to add to the mount price- but they were too cheap to do it and pushed out a half assed mount for your processor.  Lack of serious management oversight and poor leadership allowed this to happen from Line 6 staff.Solution: (yes, you will have to buy these parts at a hardware store / Lowe's, etc.  First buy some 1/4 fish aquarium tubing at china mart or your hardware store to act as a buffer between the mount and cut to appropriate length in between the bolt and the POD mounting bracket to provide tension or you can get nylon bushings to do the same.NOTE: If POD is face down on its front, Front Length = Lower 2 holes and Rear Length = Upper 2 holes.Model  Screw Thread  Front Length  Rear LengthPOD/ POD 2.0/ Bass POD:  6/32 machine  1.0&#34; or 25mm  1.25&#34; or 32mmPOD XT/ Bass POD XT:  6/32 machine  0.75&#34; or 19mm  1.00&#34; or 25mmMOTO POD (POD 2.0 2006):  6/32 machine  1.0&#34; or 25mm  1.25&#34; or 32mm",0,Negative
"I have a Fender Blues Junior that sits elevated on an amp stand, the amp stand also has a connection for a mic stand, so just go out and buy a mic boom, screw it on, then put the POD Mount at the end and you have your POD at waist height...perfect! Very sturdy construction too.",1,Negative
"The bracket is fantastic.....I have my 32"" LCD Samsung on it and I can move it with one finger. Solid as a rock....couldn't be better for $143 which includes shipping....I thought I would put a simple flat mounting plate from Sanus on the wall of my home office so I could use it in two rooms. I sent Sanus an email to get the part..a simple flat plate of metal for the wall which I thought they would charge about $20 for plus shipping...Boy was I wrong!!!!!!!! They wanted $80 for that...I can buy the whole new articulating bracket for $143 so I made one myself for less than $10. In conclusion, a great bracket but a lousy customer service rating for Sanus. $80.00 for the part is highway robbery when they probably got it for $5.00 from China!!!",0,Negative
"This thing is *HEAVY*, in fact it weights more than the 23"" Samsung LCD that is mounted to it. This wall mount is perfect if you want to install in a corner, easiliy swings out to any angle you need and has a tilt if you install it higher than eye level ... mine is installed about 7 feet off the floor. Very high quality product and it's made right here in the USA! Any other flat panels that I install will use this mount or one made by Sanus.The only drawbacks that I can note:* The mount that attaches to the rear of your flat panel blocks some of the connection on the LCD ... but in my case it only blocks the Digital Audio Out and PC input which I never plan on using anyway. If I really wanted to though I could have used a different set of holes to mount the LCD and make those connections available.* I had to buy M4x16 screws because the M4x12 and M4x30 were either too short or too long.",2,Negative
"Got this for about $60 with free 2-day shipping (Prime Member) and couldn't be happier. Hung my 50"" Panny and had no problems. Comes with all the hardware you'll need to mount your Plasma/LCD tv. (Note: Make sure you mount the bracket into your wall studs! Use a stud finder &lt;$20 at Lowe's/HD) Cheapest I found anything comparable was ~119.00, so this was a steal! Highly recommend for 50"" or smaller.",0,Negative
"This is the second mount I purchased through Amazon.  No problems with the installation - it was smooth.  I like how all the hardware you need is with the kit so no rushing out to the hardware store.  I hung a heavy Panasonic 32"" (an old model) (TC32LX70) and the mount handled it just fine.",4,Negative
"The product is fine, Amazon's misleading description isn't.  This product will not work with a VESA 200 x 200 flat panel even though the product description says: ""VESA 75, 100 and 200 compliant mounting brackets included.""  To use this mount with a VESA 200x200 panel another adapter must be purchased for ~$30 delivered.  Shame on Amazon.",0,Negative
"There's not a lot of romance in a monitor mount, it either works or doesn't.  I have a 22"" LCD mounted to mine and there is zero droop, free-play or tolerence problems. Even if I try to shake the monitor it hardly budges. Maybe it could look a little more contemporaty to go along with the shiny black of my monitor and computer but as a functional accessory it couldn't be better.  The reviewer who said it wasn't compatible with VESA 200 is incorrect.  The mounting adapter was included, he probably threw it away with the packing.",2,Negative
This wall mount works just fine for it's intended purpose.  You'd be foolish to pay more to put a tv on the wall..............,4,Negative
"The price can't be beat but it was missing screws for my new 32"" Vizio TV. I improvised around that problem but I would have rather had the appropriate screws.Shipping was fast.",4,Negative
"This was just what I needed to hang a 32"" LCD. No problems. Instructions very straight forward. Very simple and it was definately the right price!",4,Negative
"Very sturdy. Made in U.S.A. Easily holds up our 32"" LG and I suspect it could support a much larger and/or heavier screen.The only con I can think of is I wish they supplied the hex key without a right angle (i.e., just a long hex bar that could be rotated through the fingers), because it's impossible to simply keep turning it. In other words, there's not enough clearance next to the wall. And because it's such a long screw and it's so dark up there, it can take some time to keep finding the screw head each turn.Also, recently I upgraded my DVD player to an HDMI-compatible one, and it was necessary to take the TV off the mount to plug in the cable. There was no way to access this while it was still mounted. Perhaps this would be an issue with other mounts as well.Otherwise (and indeed, in spite of this), I would have no hesitation buying this again for another set.",0,Negative
"this add for this wall mount is very misleading claiming it could mount up to 46"" flatmount tv's.i think it may do a 36"" tops.we bought three and were very disatisfied with the misleading add.i think who ever is making these adds just evaluate what they are selling as they are very misleading.the product itself looked great and was very quick shipping,but the product came no where close to fitting a 42"" flatscreen!!",2,Negative
"[...]I purchased the mount for a 32"" Samsung LCD on wood studs (16"" on center).  The item was well packed to prevent scratches and there was a slew of mounting screws for different makes and models (Peerless actually provides a link to a PDF file hosted on their site: [...] which gives the screw size for several makes and models of TVs).  The instructions say to use the smallest screw first and get at least three full turns - if you use a screw that is too long it can hit the screen....ACK!  I just re-read the PDF and it does provide the width, length, and if you need to use a washer.  I didn't catch that the first time so I ended up using my own washers on the M6 screws as the provided ones did not fit (I see now because they are not required).The wall mount lag screws seemed of good quality and fine for my fairly light TV - had  this been for a larger TV I may have wanted to get some beefier ones but my buddy mounted his 52"" Samsung LCD with the same lag screws and it has not fallen yet ;).The only ding I would give the product was I felt it was a little expensive for what it is (again, at the price I paid) and as others had mentioned the ""security screws"" to lock in the bottom of the TV were pretty difficult to get to.  Not locking them in makes the TV feel not very secure in the mount.  What I ended up doing was using a flexible extension on my drill along with a security Torx bit to tighten them up.  I could have done it with the provided tool but you can only turn it 180 degrees before it hits the wall (i.e.: half a turn) and I would still be doing it :).Pros:- Holds TV very close to the wall.- Mount is very sturdy metal.- Open back provides access for recessed wiring box.- You can slide the TV all the way to the edge of the mount left or right.- TV is holding strong.Cons:- Directions could be a little clearer.- Security screws on bottom are necessary for a solid fit, but very difficult to get to.All in all I would highly recommend this mount, especially at the price it is now ($[...]).  I would have given this a 4.5 but since I cannot I am listing it as a 4 (pssst...HEY AMAZON...how about a 1 - 10 star rating???)",0,Negative
"I've used peerless mounts for quite a while now.  Honestly, they are quite easy to install (provided you have a laser level).One thing worth noting for those unfamiliar with the naming methodology...if it has the letter P after a model number, that means that the screws used for the install are philips head screws. If it doesn't have the letter P, that means it has hex head screws.Some people prefer the phillips head screws since they are easier to install.  But the hex screws offer more protection (in a robbery, the thief is less likely to have hex screwdrivers).You make the choice, but the models are exactly the same (ie SF640 and SF640P).",0,Negative
"I was searching for a mount for my new 42"" plasma TV, and found this on Amazon. Fortunately, I read the reviews and saw several complaints that this mount didn't fit certain TVs. I then went to the manufacturer's site, peerlessindustries.com, and looked up this model. Right on their product page for this item, the manufacturer warns that this model will NOT fit most TVs 42"" and higher. So, unless you want to take a chance, don't get this if your TV is 42"" or more. They really shouldn't sell a product named as a universal wall mount for 22""-49"" TVs, then have a disclaimer on their site that it won't fit many 42""+ TVs!!! UPDATED 8/23/08- the disclaimer appears to be no longer on their site but I do not know if the product has actually been changed. If you search online you will find many complaints that the mount doesn't fit many 42""+ TVs, so be warned to be carefully when considering this.",2,Negative

"This mount is very substantial in construction. It holds my heavy 58&#34; Panasonic plasma TV with ease. My only complaint is with the instructions. When I originally measured for drilling the mounting holes I &#34;assumed&#34; the TV would be centered over the center of the plate screwed to the wall. Wrong! I found out later the TV was then several inches too low. I should have placed the hanger brackets onto the TV first. Then it would have been apparent that a higher wall plate location was required for the TV to be properly located. After relocating the wall plate, it was perfect. It seems that not all TV's position the mounting brackets the same way. The effect that has over the relative centering should have been highlighted in the instructions IMHO.",2,Negative
This flange was part of the final set of hardware I used to finish off my DIY home theater install. The flange is designed so that you can use a piece of 1.5&#34; NPT threaded pipe (also called generically &#34;black pipe&#34;) to provide the required drop from a ceiling to the level where you want to mount a projector. NOTE: you will have to purchase a mount for your projector that uses that same 1.5&#34; NPT interface (I used this: &#34;Peerless PRGUNV Precision Gear Universal Projector Mount - Black&#34; also purchased on Amazon).To use this flange you have to be able to use the supplied lag bolts to secure it to your ceiling joists. For me this meant crawling into the attic and securing 2x4 &#34;cripples&#34; between a couple of ceiling joists. Another Note: try not to do this on a 90 degree summer day - learn from my mistake. Once I had the cripples installed and pre-drilled for the lag bolts the installation went smoothly.One thing that may or may not be important for you: you will see that there is an access hole on the slanted art of the flange. I used this so that I could feed an AC cord down to my projector. Peerless thoughtfully supplies a rubber grommet for this opening so that your cords don't get abraded. With the flange I received a part of the metal fabrication stuck out into the opening. This meant that I had to do some field surgery on the grommet to make it fit properly. It wasn't a big deal and 2 minutes with my small wire cutters did the trick.,0,Negative
"Nothing to say really, this is a necessary accessory if you are gonna use an extension pipe to mount. It is strong and no problems so far!",0,Negative
"I think we can make this one work, although it isn't quite strong enough to hold the TV up and under the cabinet as shone in the one photo.  The bar is also too long for a 12"" deep cabinet to be able to swing the TV up but my son said he can saw the end off.  Then I plan to put a hook under the cabinet to hook onto the bar of the mount so it WILL be able to stay up there.",2,Negative
"I used this bracket to mount a 19"" LCD under my kitchen cabinet.  The bracket is very high quality and quite sturdy.  I would have given it five stars except for one quirk I still don't understand.  The clamp that attaches to the vertical post needs to be left a little loose or you can't swivel the TV.  However if the clamp is not tight, the TV tends to walk down the post as it is being swiveled.  To fix this problem I added my own clamp collar underneath the clamp that attaches to the TV.  Now the TV swivels without walking down the post.  It was an easy fix but it seems the additional clamp should have been supplied with the kit.",0,Negative

"I ordered it yesterday from Amazon with free standard shipping and it arrived today! It works great with absolutely no problems.I attached it directly to a wall stud using the two provided lag bolts. I drilled two pilot holes with a 3/16"" drill bit about 2 1/2"" deep as shown in the instructions. I located the stud's center with an electronic stud finder. I was confused by the instructions for the mounting height dimension. I called Ergotron tech support in Minneapolis. The dimension is the height of the bottom of the wall bracket above the floor not your desk top. I am using a Samsung 2433BW monitor with the base and tilt mechanism removed.WORD OF ADVICE: Do not try to adjust the 4mm allen wrench adjustment for the up/down arm tension with the panel attached and suspended. You will probably strip the allen screw head. Adjust it to it's midrange before attaching the panel. If you need to adjust the tension once it is assembled and in place remove the arms and bracket from the wall mount bracket. Ergotron's tech support was correct, the behavior is very different once the panel is attached and the arms placed on the wall mount.I can see how some have had problems with broken screws or stripped allen heads.",0,Negative
"Product seemed like quality stuff. Got it mounted to my wall fairly easily. Within 2 hrs of having my Mac mounted to it failed. The pressed on washer that holds the adjustment screw for the up and down motion in the proper place shattered.

This is without a doubt a quality piece of engineering.It took (5) minutes to set up and you are ready to go. Even comes with all of the hardware and tools required.As the previous reviewer said, the arm shipped with two different mounting systems. One, a heavy duty desk-edge clamp, would probably have worked fine, but I opted to use the other one - a 5/16"" bolt passing through a hole drilled in the desktop. Using the bolt allows the screen to be moved to any position without worrying about the clamp coming loose. The heavy duty arm has no problem with the weight. I probably could mount a much larger monitor without a problem! If you are on the fence....I highly recommend this product.",2,Negative

"We installed the Sanus mount for a 50"" Samsung Plasma. Installation was a snap as was mounting the TV to the mount itself. Sanus supplies a wide range of screws for every TV that the mount is recommended for. The mount works smoothly, articulating in all directions and includes the ability to adjust how easily (or not so easily) you want the movement of the arm to be.After mounting it was not perfectly level and plumb, but close. The mount happily includes fine adjustments for plumb and level which were very easy to use.Recommended hole size into the studs were a bit tight, as others have noted, but using the old carpenters' trick of lubricating the lag bolt threads with soap made the job no problem. The lag bolts themselves were definately adequate but it's easy to see how trying to force the lags into the recommended hole size could snap any lag. I would never recomend going against the manufacturers hole size, however. Just take a bar of soap and scrape the lag across it, getting soap into the threads. The lag will go in smoothly.Heavy duty construction and quality paint. I would definately recommend this mount.",2,Negative
"The mount was very easy to install. You'll need a stud finder, ruler, drill, 3/16"" drill bit, and ratchet set (for the lag bolts into the studs) to install it. Make sure you have studs 16"" on center for the wall plate to mount on.It took about an hour to set up with the Sharp Aquos 42"" LC42D64U. Once installed the mount swings and tilts with minimal resistance. The mount is sturdy enough that it does not flex when supporting this TV (~50 lbs.) The wall mount extends far enough to allow my TV to be used in a corner position or when I want to have it lie flat against the wall (the mount adds around 2-3"" of depth when it is against the wall.The only con with this mount was one of the four lag bolts sheared off when I tried to ratchet it in (my reason for only four stars.) A royal pain as there was no way I was getting that piece out of the stud. Luckily, I had some lag bolts of a similar size from another DIY project, drilled a new pilot hole, and ratcheted it in. It offers a decent value for the price.",2,Negative
"Purchase 11/2009Installed 11/2009Overall Rating  -  GoodPros  -  Simple design, fairly easy instalation.  Paint/finish quality good.Costs similar to other quality mounts.Cons  -  Instructions were too simple, not enough detail.  Cable management is not good, mounts are sloppy with simple wire ties.  For this level of mount I would expect more. Tilt and other adjustments are good but again instructions were lacking.Install issues  -  None.Price Paid - $243",4,Negative

"I'm downrating this product BEFORE I actually use it to hopefully catch your attention BEFORE you buy it! I read a bunch of reviews here, mostly favorable. One noted the itme pictured here on Amazon is different then what came. TRUE. It is also DIFFERENT than the item in the PDF from the Peerless site!! Seems there are 3 LCS-KLA'a but nobody (Peerless) has bothered to revision them ie. -1 -2 -3 etc. What I thought was the one in the PDF was the correct one, WRONG. The one pictured on the Peerless site IS the correct one. So it has a flat/squareish TV side plate with eight ROUND screw holes (not tear shaped) and it does NOT roll +/- 5 degrees. If you've ever hung a TV before tear shaped screw holes let you hang the TV on the already wall mounted arm EASILY! The 5 degree roll lets you correct a less than perfect install. I'm am currently waiting for a call back from a Peerless tech. I showed the CSR the bad PDF.",2,Negative
"This is a quality wall mount. Both long and short screws are provided to attach LCD TV. Articulating arms are tight without any wobble. Mount articulates both left and right, as well as tilts up and down for viewing from any angle. Only criticism, a small one and more an annoyance:  once holes are drilled in the wall, there is no level adjustment. I took care to drills the holes vertically, and yet the TV still has a slight tilt. I do not see how perfect horizontal alignment of the TV is possible without some adjustment feature lacking in this productAlso, I suggest using a tool larger than a hand Phillips screwdriver, such as an electric drill with Phillips bit. A cordless drill is unlikely to have enough power to install these large screws. Overall:  a quality product that is straightforward to mount, and sturdy enough for a 19"" LCD TV.",0,Negative

"The engineering on this device is superb.The only problem I had was I broke the head off one of the lag bolts while bolting the bracket to the wall. My neighbor had the same issue. Is the wood too hard in my walls? or is the lag bolt not strong enough?I went to Virgil's and bought 4 new lag bolts, to make sure they were all good.It's great how I can point the Sony TV in any direction!",0,Negative
"The Design is great and exactly what i needed. It's got a very easy brainless setup but the LAG bolts were really cheap. I went and spent 3.86 on new lagbolts and asked amazon compensation! I broke 2 of the lag bolts just ratcheting them. They literally snapped off! I've never EVER had this with a lag bolt, ever.  So that's my advice. If you buy this item spend about 3-4$ for higher quality lagbolts. Other than that it's a great item but because i got inferior quality bolts i  can't give this item any higher than 3 star.",0,Negative
"bought this for my 24-port patch panel (tripp lite) and my dlink 24-port GB switch.  The only thing i didn't like was the fact that after i mounted my DLINK switch, there was no room for the plug.

I would buy again if I would use it for just patch panels...but not for switches.",3,Negative

Very nice shelf. I use it to put my projector on it which weights 20lbs and it holds it up with no problem.,3,Negative
The shelf normally sticks out a little further than I would like but I figured out a way to correct that problem. The 3 screws attaching the shelf to the arm hold the shelf from turning. I decided to install just the center screw and was able to rotate the shelf to one side up against the wall. Now it doesn't stick out like before. It helped the one draw back I had with the shelf.,3,Negative
"The shelf is attractive, functional, and appears to be well made.  I got it to hold a video projector high on a wall.  It does that well, permitting left-right adjustments with its pivoted support.  Compared to a ceiling mount, though, this solution is inferior because it does not make tilting easy.  For that we have had to prop up the front and/or back of the projector to make it fit properly on the screen across from it.  As with a ceiling mount, we found that we wanted to place the projector upside down.  Then we added wood blocks and shims and....  Our ceiling fan made a ceiling mount problematic.  But this is not the perfect solution to that problem.",3,Negative

"Bought this because we have hardwood floors and my turntable was situated in a cabinet; anytime someone would walk by, the needle would jump across the record like crazy.  This solved my problem; now the only way to skip the record is to pound on the wall.  It looks better than the cabinet, so i bought another one to hold my receiver and got rid of the cabinet altogether.Only gripe is the plastic cover that is supposed to assist in cord management pops loose if you so much as breathe on it.  And it will eventually just pop off on its own.  No biggie, just pop it back into place.",3,Negative
"This is a quality unit and works as advertised. The only thing I didn't like about it is that if you are mounting it in a corner along with an LCD TV, the glass does not rotate making its use awkward.",3,Negative
"It's a quality product with attractive looks. However, it sticks out very far from the wall. If you, unlike me, have no problem with space, then go for it.

It makes the product seem as if doesn't stick out much.",2,Negative
"I had to take it away because it looks awful, the glass is not close to the wall as it seems in the picture, it looks like an a floating arm.",3,Negative
it's a heavy shelf and has a substantial space to put stuff on. It can swivle too. It didn't work for me because it was in a walk way and stuck too far out.,3,Negative
This shelf is very well constructed- but very very heavy! It took two people to attach it to the wall- with struggle.  If your walls are weak you might want to think twice about this unit.  But if you think they can handle it- go for it! Very nice looking and very functional.,2,Negative
"If you have a large, heavy plasma TV and you need to span three 18"" centered wall studs, this is one of your very few choices in the $100-$200 range.  It took ordering three different wall mounts before I found this one because the specs on Amazon (and other sites for that matter) are either confusing or flat-out wrong.  Most of the time when they give you dimensions, it's the size of the carton that they give rather than the size of the mounting bracket itself.  I even contacted a real person at Amazon for the info on my second try and she was just as wrong as I was the first time.  Why it's so hard for a company to add a couple of inches to a wall bracket mystifies me, but there are hundreds of $100 mounts that go 30"" and only one or two (like this one) that are longer. So, unless you want your $2000 TV dangling precariously 16"" over from two studs in your wall, get one that spans more than 36"" like this one.  The major complaint I have on this particular unit is that the adjusting knob that is supposed to allow you to tilt the screen up or down a bit (handy for getting to cables and such after installation) is designed in such a way that the bracket's proximity to the wall prevents you from loosening it.  So once you've got your behemoth screen in place, you're stuck with whatever angle you've set it at.  Over all, though, it's a sturdy mount with one main problem, and if you're willing to live with that design flaw--go for it.",2,Negative
"I used this mount to hang a 23&#34; monitor with an Apple TV stuck to the back. It stays where I place it. The huge lag bolts that came with it made me realize this manufacturer is the real deal, no puny little #8 x 1&#34; zinc plated fasteners with this kit!",2,Negative
"I ordered this mount because of the weight limit.  I have a 110 pound plasma I wanted to mount, so it needed to be sturdy.  Took me about 45 minutes to install it total (I am pretty handy)...I stripped out one of the screws for the TV brackets, but probably my own fault for trying to get the thing mounted too quickly.  A quick trip to the local hardware store and 30 cents remedied this problem.  The mount went up quickly...was self explanatory for someone who is semi-handy.  The mount does stick out from the wall a bit, but most tilt models have at least 2.5 inches of protrusion, so no big deal for the extra half inch on this one.  Looks great and holds my heavy plasma with no problems so far...would highly recommend!",0,Negative
"Once I opened the box, I saw how it worked and threw the instructions. It didn't take long to hang, but all except one of the lag bolts broke, even after pre-drilling! So I tried the drywall anchors, and they wouldn't expand as they should.I ended up buying new lag bolts and drywall anchors. After this, everything went flawlessly.I was only able to hit two studs and they were pretty well centered on the mount, so each lag bolt was probably 8 or 10 inches from the edge of the mount. With 4 lag bolts in this mount, even my 50"" plasma wasn't going anywhere. However, the plasmas mounts put all the stress on the very outside edge of the wall part of the mount, causing it to bend out from the wall, up to the point where the lag bolts were. I then put drywall anchors on the extreme edge holes on the wall mount. That took care of that problem. If this thing ever falls, my wall is coming with it.Like I said, great mount, crappy bolts and screws.",2,Negative
"These racks are a breeze to assembleVery sturdy, Plenty of room, comes with lots of cage nuts and screws, also comes with cable management hooks the go on each post.I have this rack holding music equipment in a church.I installed two amps in the bottom to lower the center of gravity, made my own shelves out of plywood and 4 2"" carriage bolts stuck through the square holes already on the side which hold my CD changer, tape deck, and computer.I ordered this through Amazon and their packaging was rough. It was open on both ends and one end the cardboard was completely gone. **Despite the box being pretty damaged, the rack did not have a scratch on it**",1,Negative

I ordered this for some lightweight network equipment.  It was poorly packed when shipping so it came with a damaged box.  I was thinking there are probably missing parts.

"To the guy who gave it 1 star... you forgot to do your homework before buying a $300 wall mount. Thats on you, not the mount. 16"" studs are standard, and you can always cut out some sheetrock and make a brace.There is a slider and slotted bolt holes so you can center the tv about 6-10 inches off the center of the studs.After I mounted it, I fully extended it and hung my body weight from it (175 lb) before attaching the TV with no problems.Cable management could be better.",2,Negative
"I wish I could give this product a better rating, but here is my experience:I framed in a window to mount our new TV, and I installed the articulating half of this mount to the wall without issue. There was ample hardware included with the mount. But when it came time to mount the TV, I found that the threaded holes that are used to mount the two plates together were stripped out. My box had the seal broken on it, but the packaging looked fine. It would appear that I received an open box item instead of the new product that I paid for. The threads were so bad that I could push the screws through two of the holes with minimal resistance. The plate is aluminum, so it is probably easy to over torque them if you are not careful. I found some nuts that fit and used the longer screws that came with the packaging, so I continued with the install. I got an email from the seller asking for feedback, so I told them about my issue. They did not reply. Shame, shame.",0,Negative
"Okay,the ease of install could be a little better, but really there is no major reason to complain.  You just gotta look at the diagrams, and do a little wrench work.  When I dumped out all the parts, anticipation was worse than actual difficulty of install.  The work great, and I'm thinking about getting a third arm (w/ an extender) for my third screen.Customer service sucks and is clueless, but anyone who invests in these is going to be smarter than customer service anyways.A good buy for the cash.",0,Negative
"I have to admit I was worried about all that would be involved in mounting a 32"" LCD using this mount, but instead the entire process went amazingly quickly. In fact, the longest part of the install was marking the studs on the wall.The mount is completely adjustable and I appreciate the small amount of tilt the mount allows in case in the process of attaching the lag bolts the mounting plate gets pulled slightly off-plumb.  It's incredibly sturdy and I have no concerns about it holding and lasting the life of multiple TVs.Do be sure you know where on the mount you want the included cable clips, as they will snap off rather than come out of the holes - but nothing that can't be worked around with regular cable ties.The kit literally comes with everything you will likely need save for a stud finder. All lag bolts and all attachment bolts to the TV itself are included.The one very small caveat is that the horizontal plumb of the attached TV will vary a little depending upon how far the arm is extended, so if you adjust the TV to be level with the arm fully extended it will be ever so slightly tilted when you push the arm back up against the wall.  However you'll only notice with the use of a level - it's not an issue in real-world use.Note also that there are TWO allen wrenches included with the mount, and the slightly larger silver one is the one you need to adjust the TV's horizontal tilt once it's attached.  I was frustrated that Sanus included the ""wrong size"" allen wrench in the hardware kit until I found the second wrench - duh.In short, I can't recommend this mount highly enough.",2,Negative
"Real nice weight to it, easy to install into wood studs. Mounted a Samsung UN32C4000 but I had to run to the hardware store to buy M8x20mm cap screws to attach the LCD since it only came with M4, M5, and M6's in various lengths.Only con is that there is no way to lock the brackets so that it doesn't slide side to side. Once the LCD is mounted it can slide side to side ... but I guess it really shouldn't move if the bracket screwed level to the wall and you dont touch it. It wouldn't take much for Sanus to have a set screw (from angle brackets to wall bracket) to keep it from sliding. Note that there is no way for it to slide off ... it does have hard stops.",0,Negative

"I wasn't wowed with this mount... it was hard to install, as the screws wanted to strip (yes, i predrilled the holes). As a few other reviewers stated, the mount seems like it twists when the tv is mounted. The weight of the tv cases some of the hinges to rotate, this makes your tv look crooked. My tv is 26"" and weights 13lbs, the mount appears to be holding it with no problems, easy to move to get good viewing angle.",2,Negative
"I bought this bracket to hang a 29&#34; flat screen TV I purchased.  The product seems sturdy enough.  I am giving it two stars for the following:1. The two black mounting screws, which support the weight of the TV are such inferior quality that I landed up destroying the heads for one of them.  This is in spite of the pilot holes I had drilled.  This is the biggest deal breaker.  I am handy and happened to have other long mounting screws handy in the house.  Some of you may not be that lucky.2. The only way to level the TV is to loosen the bottom mounting screw and realign the bracket using a level.There was too much play in the moving parts.  I was able to adjust that by tightening the joints using the Allen wrench provided with the product.  Since I did it after mounting the TV, the TV was not leveled horizontally.The bottom line is that spend a bit more money and find a bracket which provides movement in all three directions.",0,Negative

"For $19.95, this is a solid very well made mount.I used this to mount a small LCD in my workshop and I am very please with the quality of this product.Like many mounts, these come with cross-point screws to mount to the wall or stud.When mounting to studs, I prefer to instead use lag bolts so I can use a wrench or ratchet to install/remove them.If you don't get the pilot holes drilled big enough when you use cross-point screws, you can easily round-out the cross-point head which  then makes screw installation or removal difficult.",0,Negative
"I have purchased another style for my tv, and this was for a monitor. The ability to adjust angle is great, it doesn't have a long reach, but allows you to put the monitor out where you need it, and stow it away too. Really easy to install, I just leveled it and screwed it in. It came with different VESA screws in different lengths as well. No complaints.",2,Negative
"Overall this is a good wall mount.  But the mounting screws for the wall are so soft. Even using the right screwdriver the philip head on it still break it, the head of the screw seems to be falling off the screw soon. :(The other thing I wanna mention is that the mounting holes on the arm doesn't align with the center of the monitor mounting plate.  So if you find a stud behind the wall, your monitor will not be centre to the stud, it will be 4 inch to the left or to the right if you push the screen all the way against the wall (fully flat)",2,Negative
"Just as the 3 stars say, this mount is just okay.  I bought it to use it in an RV for a small 19&#34; tv.  The tv is in the &#34;master bedroom&#34; and I wanted to be able to pull the tv out and swivel it down for easier viewing while laying in bed.  While it does do this, the problem is that it is not strong enough to hold the tv in the right position.  If I cranked the bolts tight, it would work, but every time I would swing it in or out, the bolts would loosen up and the tv would flop down again.So if you are mounting it somewhere and can set it and forget it, it should work fine.  If you want to actually move it occasionally, you will be tightening up the bolts on a regular basis.",2,Negative
"worked just fine and held my monitor with no issues. Didn't come with mounting screws, so keep that in mind.",0,Negative
"I've gone through about 15 of these and they are well constructed and affordable.  Unfortunately it seems they have slightly modified the design and there is too much play on the bottom screw hole now (more like a screw oval).  This causes the mount to slip to the side.I'm not sure if it was just 2 bad ones in a row or a design change, if it was a design change then I suggest trying their newer model out.",0,Negative
"The monitor mount had a joint that is meant for tilting the screen forwards or backwards. This joint is very loose and wobbly, even though it's tightened all the way, and causes the screen to tilt left and right and be crooked.When the whole arm is extended, the screen rests tilted to one direction so its obviously not level, and when the arm is retracted the screen rests tilted to the other direction and also obviously not level. This also makes it so you can't adjust the screws holding it to the wall to fix the tilt either way.",0,Negative
"This mount was used to install a Vizio 24"" LED TV.  Sure, the TV only weighed 6lbs, but the mount has no problem supporting it.  My only gripe, and the reason it didn't get five stars, is that the metal composition of the included wood screws is low quality.  I recommend using appropriately sized, quality wood screws to hold the mount to the wall.  Both the screw heads quickly stripped out when I used my drill to drive them into pre-drilled holes.",0,Negative
"Not many years ago, wall mounts for flat-screen TVs typically cost $100 or more.  The VideoSecu mount is made of good quality materials and the components operate smoothly.  We mounted a 19"" TV near the corner of a kitchen countertop so that it can be folded flat against one of the walls to make full use of the countertop when the TV isn't being used.  We did not encounter any of the tilt or leveling issues described by a couple reviewers, perhaps because I checked both horizontal and vertical leveling before installing the 2nd wallmounting screw.  Also, drilling pilot holes prior to installing the mounting screws helps avoid damage to the screw heads and makes it easier to intall the screws.",2,Negative
"Plenty stout to hold a 21"" monitor with no noticable sag.  The tilt feature is very nice.  Installation was simple enough; I didn't have a stud where I wanted it, so fixed a piece of finished wood about an inch bigger in all dimensions than the wall-mount bracket using drywall anchors, then screwed the arm to that.  Leveling was simple, the bottom hole is elongated to allow some adjustments.  The torpedo level magnet sticks to the arm, so you have both hands free to make sure the arm is level, tightenign the screw with one hand while applying whatever push is needed to keep the arm level until the bottom screw is tight.  The allen-wrench that comes with the bag of screws can be used to tighten or loosen the adjustment screws at the shoulder/elbow/wrist, but I didn't need to use it.  The adjustments were tight enough and didn't move once the monitor was where I wanted it.  The two big screws to hold it to the wall are black, but the small screws that hold the monitor to the arm (they come with the kit) are silver-colored rather than black; so the monitor is black, and the arm is black, but the screws are metal color.  But who looks at the back of the thing?  I'd buy another any time.",0,Negative

"This fits my 24"" Vizio Razor LED TV perfectly. It is lightweight but seems like it can hold its own. Better still, it has a wide range of motion and just gets the job done.BEWARE: the screws that come to mount the arm into the wall stud are about as useful as a wax screw. They strip to hell, bend and shred with the slight bit if stress. Use your own.",2,Negative

After some months of using the product (swinging back & forth, up & down) the product still feels tight and holds it's position nicely.I don't like &#34;made in China&#34; screws, would suggest you use others to avoid stripping the head and frustration.Still deserves five stars even with the cheesy screws.",0,Negative
"The directions that came with this were pretty useless, but really it's only two screws so find a stud.  I paired this with a 24"" viewsonic monitor.  I mounted it in the corner of our kitchen and put an emachines nettop behind it.  I only plan on using it to display photo slideshows and Netflix so I'm using mobile mouse pro on my iphone to control it (no keyboard to clutter the counter top).  As others have mentioned the display will rotate a little, but in the corner and under a cabinet you can't tell.  I guess if you have to have it level you could put the top screw in first and make it tight, then adjust for level before putting in the second screw.",2,Negative
"The bracket is easy to install, and also mounts easily to your flat screen TV. But that's not what I like best about it. It's very inconspicuous, and you forget it's even there. The television pretty much makes it invisible.  And the bracket is so versatile. You can rotate the TV to almost any angle.  We have two of these - one in the kitchen, and one on the porch.",2,Negative
I have about 20 of these on all my computers.  Easy to install and looks very nice.  Very sturdy.  I had read elsewhere about breaks but out of the 20 I have yet to have one break yet.  I think it is more installer aggression at fault.,1,Negative

"1. The mount is naturally uneven form the base. If the base attached to the wall is even, the arm attached to the monitor is slightly crooked (1-2mm off, noticeable to me), so (with two people), have one person use a leveler (ON THE MONITOR) when the monitor is attached to the arm and put marks on the wall according.2. If you are mounting into a stud (not using dry wall hardware), ditch the screws that came with. Get some heavy duty metal screws (10-15 cents, cheap). The ones I had broken when trying to put them into the stud (with holes drilled). I, fortunately, had some 3 inch screws laying around and used them instead.3. It can really hold up anything (In it's capacity), just make sure to torq BOTH sides of the arm enough so the monitor doesn't lean.All in all not to bad for the price.Recommendations:-Two People-New MOUNTING screws (arm screws into monitor is fine)-Mount into stud, don't waste your time into drywall.-If you decide to use normal hardware, drill good holes and have a crowbar/hammer ready to pull out any broken screws (One broke and the other lost its top, fortunately the crowbar got it out)",2,Negative
Still use it everyday with no issues. I have bought many of these types of things for use in different situations. Some were only available at premium rates but I cant honestly tell the difference in quality.At one point in time I had a piece of 1/4 inch plexiglass cut and formed to cradle my laptop and mounted it to this thing. There is enough up/down pivot in this thing that it worked as a desk and allowed me to swing my laptop out of the way when not in use at my shop desk. My friend seen it and did the same thing for his wireless mechanical keyboard on his shop cart. That should be a descent enough testimonial to how sturdy it is. I am back to using it as intended to hold a touch screen monitor for my CNC machine.,2,Negative
Normally don't do reviews but I felt compelled for this item. For 20 bucks I was skeptical. When I saw the box it came in (very small) I was worried. But I have to say this mount is crafted and works well. I would not recommend exceeding the weight requirements. My only complaint is the mounting screws that hold the unit to the wall. If you try to use them in studs the heads will strip. I replaced mine with hex headed screws. Other than that this is a great deal for 20 bucks.,2,Negative
You need to make only one hole first and then mound the TV and then level the TV and then screw in the 2nd screw. The weight of the TV makes the mount tilt so this is very important.Also note that the vesa mount side is not centered over the wall bracket but is actually offset to one side by 2-3 inches. This is because the double arm length is not the same as the single arm length. The single arm is 2-3 inches shorter than the double arm.These guys should provide this length info in the description but they dont.,0,Negative
"Very nice for the money, but there are some problems.  The instructions don't seem to say the size of the pilot hole for the screws and the screws are aluminum (I think).  Screw it in too hard because the hole is tight and you strip the philips head.  I got some stainless steel ones locally and installation was a snap.  One more problem is that no matter what, there is some play in each hinge.  It is not much but add it all together and if your TV, even a 19&#34; one like mine, is weighted more to one side, when the arm is extended, the TV is slightly at an angle, vertically even if the bracket on the wall is correct.  If you have a good eye, this can be very annoying and you find yourself doing all sorts of things with washers, adjustments, and ties to make it straight.",0,Negative
Why spend $50-$100 on a wall mount at local retailers when you can spend only $15 on this one. The construction is the same as the more expensive ones in the stores. For the people that have purchased and said there is a little unlevelness when installed. There is an allen wrench provided with the wall mount. Snug up all screws before you mount and there will be no problem.,0,Negative

"I just installed it yesterday, so cannot comment on durability yet.  The arm and bracket seem well-manufactured and solid.  My 19-inch LCD TV mounted solidly with no problems.However, the supplied hardware is unbelievably bad -- particularly the wood screws.  They completely stripped after only a few seconds of light rotations (this was after I had already drilled the pilot holes).  Seriously, are they made of pewter??  These are the poorest quality screws I'd ever seen.***Please make sure you go to the hardware store and spend 50 cents on a pair of good-quality metal screws.  Otherwise, if these strip and you can't reverse-screw them, you're SOL and will be stuck with these crap screws in your wall with no way to remove them.***Also, the supplied wrench doesn't really fit properly into the adjustment sockets -- mine was too small.Made in China, and it shows -- not only with a proud, bold sticker that says this on the bracket, and but with poor-quality hardware and a manual so badly translated that it may as well not come with a manual.BUT....despite some frustrations, it ultimately worked.  For now.",0,Negative

"I needed something light and small for use with a new TV for my RV flatscreen.  It works great for that, cant be happier.  Came with all the mounting hardware etc.  Only comment is that the articulation is off-centered from the center of the tv.  In other words the center of the mount where it screws into the wall is not centered on the back of the tv, so you have to account for that when mounting.  Since I was in an RV I had limited space to offset it, but I made it work.",2,Negative
"I purchased 2 of these in July 2011 and have been using them since.  For the price, these can not be beat.  Sometimes the arms and tilt need to be tightened with an allen wrench, but I think I have done that maybe 2-3 times since using them.  I have had a heavy lcd 22&#34; monitor on it and a light led 24&#34; monitor with no issues.  Will buy these again if I ever need more.",2,Negative
"I used this to mount my Asus 27 inch IPS monitor. Easy to install, but beware of the cheap screws supplied. While screwing the screws in, they both got stripped.

"This is exactly what I was looking for. Can be stiff or loose depending on how you tighten the sections. Holds a 22"" widescreen monitor with the regular screws that came with it. Will repurchase exact same item if I ever decided to mount another monitor.",2,Negative
Fast and simple installation.  Does what it says it will do.  I have no complaints. It is very low profile when folded dlat agains the wall.  The lowest profile unit I could find.  Buy this mount if you only need 18 inches of extension.,2,Negative
"If you're only ever going to view your screen when it's parallel to the mounting wall this would be OK once the tilt is adjusted for the arm's droop. In any other orientation, i.e. angled from the wall, this poor-quality, sloppy, floppy, droopy arm will result in your screen hanging at a crazily unwatchable angle. Even if you tighten all the bolts as far as they'll go, the crappy metal this is made of and the poor manufacturing tolerances will result in it twisting.",2,Negative
"This mount is only strong enough for a 22 inch TV, in my opinion.  It appears well-built, and comes with all hardware, including screws to insert into back of TV.  Only problem I experienced is that the long wall-mounting screws are of such soft steel, that unless you use precisely the right Phillips driver bit, you will strip the head of the screw.  Be very careful in mounting.",0,Negative
"I used this item to mount my 22"" Acer LCD computer monitor to the wall above my computer desk. The intent was to create more workable space and be able to push the monitor out of the way when working at the desk. It mounted fine, though there was some shifting when the monitor was mounted and the screen was positioned all the way out. I didn't care because this is a computer monitor, but for someone using this as a TV mount may be frustrated by the slight tilt to the side when fully extended.It is adjustable in the following ways:1) away from the wall2) side to side3) tilting up and downIt will not adjust in a twisting fashion and it was in this dimension that it shifted. I would recommend this product with reservations for the reasons indicated above.",2,Negative
This would get 5 stars if the screws weren't a little too loose. I will be buying larger screws so I can tighten this up on the back of the TV.,0,Negative

I totally recommend this mount for lcd screens, (which mine was a 26"" vizio).Great product and very inexpensive.",4,Negative

"I went ahead and ordered the mount knowing that people had issues with stripped screws and mounting, which worried me the entire time until I finally mounted it.Because of Amazons fake mount warning, I first checked to make sure a VideoSecu logo was on the mount and as it was I decided to mount the monitors.I bought two, one for an Asus VE228 and an Asus VH238H. Both use Vesa 100 & they both properly mounted, without sag when fully extended like many other people experienced. I used the mounting kit included with the bracket & nothing stripped even with power tools for both installations.",0,Negative
"Great mount for the money, though the hardest part is if you are not perfectly vertically aligned, then there is no way to adust that.  I also had to adjust the tension on the allen bolts on the head after they loosened.  Use this to mount a monitor under a kitchen cabinet so we can pull it out when needed and tuck away otherwise.",2,Negative
I received in record time! (signed up for the free 5 to 8 day shipping got it the next day!)This is the second mount I purchased via Amazon and I must say I like this one better. My display is easily moved left right back forth & tilted up and down with this mount. That said I quickly stripped the low quality mounting screws provided with the mount trying to attach it to a two by four that was not covered by drywall. I solved this issue by replacing the low quality screws with stainless steel 3 inch lag bolts that I happened to have from a prior project. Thin black 3 inch oxide screws to hold up something as pricy and important as a PC monitor or HDTV seems rather foolish but then this was a very low priced mount. The mount itself seems fine. I would purchase again and indeed I am considering purchasing again to get one for my sister and one for my mother as gifts. I will also send them lag bolts to replace the screws however.,2,Negative
"Ordered for my daughter's 22&#34; TV.  Like it, but the only thing that worries me is how we mounted it.  It comes with mollies that for their size should hold 40# with no problems.  The tv is probably around 30#, the dilemma is we used the mollies because where we had to put it the stud mount was out of the question.  No problem, right?  We will see.  After mounting it I was putting everything back in the box and noticed a warning on the instructions which stated to stud mount only.  We obviously didn't read the directions first as my husband is handy and it was a simple install, but why put mollies in if you're not supposed to use them?  We shall see how it holds up.  Keeping my fingers crossed that I won't find the tv on her dresser.  The item itself seems sturdy and well made.",3,Negative

"the mount is sturdy enough so you know that it isn't going to fall off of the wall. we had to unscrew it at the joints and put threadlocker on the threads, then we tightened them to where we wanted them and called it a day. when fully extended, our 27 inch touch screen (19 lbs) does make the mount sag noticably, but not enough where you fear for your safety. DO NOT MOUNT IT WITH THE INCLUDED WOOD SCREWS. get your own quality wood screws and screw directly into your wall studs, or be ridiculous like me and replace your drywall with 1.25 inch plywood and bolt it to that.the included monitor screws are good enough, but the screws for your wall are terrible.

"I was a little slow in realizing why a wrench was included as no mentioned was made of the necessity to tighten the joints. However, after installing it on the wall (very simple job) but because of the looseness of the joints I thought  maybe they forgot to put the springs on when the light came on (that happens alot at my age) and I saw the hex bolts at each joint. Adjusted each joint to the tension needed and now I'm a happy camper. I've recommended it to others without reservation. Great purchase and it does all it's advertised to do!",0,Negative
Very easy and simple to install. Has three adjustments that allow precise placement for you monitor. I suspended mine about 2 inches just above my desktop and suspended out from the wall about 8 inches using the swivel feature. It just barely comes over my desktop by a few inches and looks neat with no mounting stand on the desk.,2,Negative
"So so product.  Made in China.  The arm comes with lots of machine screws to fit any monitor/tv.  The base screws only come as wood screws with plastic hammer in anchors.  It would have been nice to have included some machine screws with washers and nuts for those of us mounting this to our desks.  Beyond that, the main problem is that there is too much play in the arm joints.  You can fix this on some of the joints by tightening the tension screw while holding the joint in center.  Not ideal...  The worst part is that the base of the arm attaches with a multi-tooth and they only have a tension screw at the top.  No matter how tight you make this screw, it doesn't put enough pressure through the whole joint to eliminate the play in the bottom half.  So, you get a slightly off kilter mount.  I have mine mounted on my desk which is level.  The base of the arm is level.  The actual posts in the arm are a little off and progressively worse at each joint.  Because I have mine at a 90 degree angle, this means my monitor is lopsided.  Not by much but enough to bother me just a little.  Had the joint axels been just slightly more snug, this would not be an issue.  There has to be a better product out there for not much more money.",0,Negative

"This is a great little mount, I have two and they each hold a 22-inch LCD TV in my RV. The only problem I had is that the bolts tend to loosen and the TV's move around as I drive. I tighten the bolts and they still tend to get loose over time, I'm not sure if the metal is stretching or regular movement tends to loosen them. I don't want to use lock-tite for fear of committing to a tension, but some straps should hold things in place while in transport. For non-RV use, these are very versatile and solid!",0,Negative
"This is okay and I tried to follow the mounting advice of D. Mill which was very informative.  The most difficult part is getting the TV level horizontally once mounted.  I took a level and mounted the bracket level with the wall.  This does not work very well because once you tighten everything up the t.v. bracket, the TV  is not completely level.  The bottom wall mount screw allows for some ""tweeking"" sideways and that helps.  I do prefer the units that have a ""ball joint"" by the back of the TV which allows for vertical and horizonal movement as well as LEVELING of the TV.  Once in place, you can tighten the ball joint snug and you are done.  Those hangers are more expensive but if you are OCD, pay the extra  money and get one with a universal joint that allows for 3 in 1 correction.",0,Negative

"Did scan all (?) the reviews for reasonably cheap mounts and sort of got stuck on this one (really saw no need to pay more than $20 for a very simple piece of hardware).We needed a mount for 23 inch LED/LCD TV in the bedroom. Always a tad concerned to mount a piece of equipment on essentially  one ""anchoring"" point (note, this is no different than any other mount for similar sized displays), but as long as you do not over-tighten, should be no issues. Always leery for ""wiggliness"" in an articulated mount.But now that mount is up, works as planned, and will likely buy two more for the LCD monitors I have in the office (need to get them up from the desk).One small but important design detail is that the lower (wall bracket) mounting hole is slightly elongated. That means that you have a decent chance to simply adjust the mount to ""plum"" as otherwise you might need to re-drill elsewhere if you screw up (NPI), as any deviation in a short wall bracket is multiplied in any mount with longer arms.The mount comes with an assortment of screws and anchors.",2,Negative
"Prior to mounting this model, I mounted another TV with Sanus full motion flat panel mount.  The Sanus was a breeze to mount TV with and very sturdy. This unit, made by VideoSecu was a different story.  Instead of using large lag bolts (like the Sanus)to mount bracket with, VideoSecu decides to use cheaply made phillips head screws.  I drilled pilot holes, but even with that both screws cammed out before tightening completely.  So, I had to get them back out with pliers and mount bracket with a couple of zinc coated construction screws.  In the meantime, the wall paint ended up getting scratched and thing is one piece, so TV has to be balanced while all this is going on.  I was totally aggravated by the time I got through with this project...This mount seems flimsy compared to the Sanus, I just hope TV stays on the wall.Pay a little more and get a much better mount, such as the Sanus SF213-B1 from J&R;.",0,Negative
"Used this with my 60' Samsung TV and I installed it all myself. My wife helped me actually pick up my TV and mount it, but other than that I did it all with a stud finder, drill, pencil, and level.Planning the placement of the TV was the most difficult part. After that it was cake. Again I want to stress that I would highly recommend placing all of your screws in the wall on the wood studs in the wall. I placed mine on three studs just to be completely certain that it would not fall on a family member/child.",0,Negative
The Mount that I received was not the one that is shown here. If this one is not in the stock then need to be removed from the list.The one that got is somewhat similar.

"This was easy enough to install.  I just bought a new house and on the same day, my son turned 1.  He loved playing with the Xbox and other devices in our entertainment center, so I thought if I mounted the TV on the wall, I could put stuff out of his reach where the TV used to sit.  I have a Dynex 32"" LCD TV with an 80x80 VESA pattern.  Got the back plate mounted on the wall - really sturdy construction, I mounted it into studs so I didn't need the plastic pressure caps - the bolts included seemed sufficiently high quality that I didn't feel a need to get a replacement.  The one issue I had arose when I went to mount the bracket arms to the TV.  None of the included bolts fit the mount points on my TV - they were all too wide.  Poor documentation on both the TV and the wall mount contributed to the difficult of getting a good replacement.  I measured the length of both sizes of bolts included and counted the threads to get an idea of what type of bolt to buy for my TV.  The replacements I bought were the right diameter, odd length (I had to use several nuts as washers) wrong thread count - but close enough that I was able to attach the TV securely.  When I replace this TV it will likely never be able to be wall mounted again (but I don't care - when this TV is replaced it'll probably be dead).  So that was a disappointment, but I'm not sure how common it is to not have the included bolts work - they include several sizes and types, so it's likely the fault of Dynex for using a non-standard (probably to force people to pay outrageous prices at the Brick and Mortar that shall not be named).  I won't complain about having to spend $2 on bolts for a wall mount that's less than a 1/4 of mounts sold at brick and mortars.",2,Negative

"As another review noted, the levels are not very accurate.  It would be a very nice feature if they were accurate.  Use your own level!  I wish I had read the reviews a little more and seen that comment.  It was close enough for my eye, but it is severely lacking in the wife acceptance factor.  As soon as I placed one of my levels on the TV, or the wall bracket, after mounting I saw it was off.Barring that issue, the bracket is very sturdy, and much more reasonably priced than many other mounts.  I also had a power outlet directly under the TV, so I ended up buying a recessed outlet, added some 3/4 inch wood blocks and longer lag screws to set it off from the wall a little.",0,Negative

The only negative I would say about this is that once the TV is mounted, I couldn't reach my hand behind it to adjust tilt. That might be because of the shape/size of my TV though, so I don't want to make too much of it.",2,Negative
"This bracket works very well but one caution - mount it high enough so you can reach up behind your TV to tighten the screws.

Then, unfortunately it turned out that TV that it was bought for was defective so I had to return it.  If not for that, I did think it was a great item and I would buy it again.",0,Negative
"I purchased this to hang my LC52 and had workmen come to my home to hang it, only to find IT WAS TOO SMALL FOR MY TV!!!!  I called the manufacturer and was told I had to buy an adapter! I wasted my time and MONEY hiring a workman to put the TV on the wall for nothing.  Now I have to wait until the new part comes and reschedule and pay for the workmen to come again!  They should either include the adapters OR at least warn you that you need them for large TV's.  The wall plate should be wider which would solve all the problems.  Beware!",2,Negative
"Does its job, hides behind the TV. Issues are as follows:a) Too little clearance behind the TV to plug in the wires or make changes.b) Tilt action has 2 hooks on each side and either you leave them lose or tighten them in place for a fixed tilt angle, changing them is not easy as the bolt for the inside hooks are hard to reach esp. given the clearance from the wall and the height and depth of the bolt from the side.c) Screws to the bottom are too difficult to reach and you could get into an issue with removing the TV if these screws are too tight i.e. if you need to pull the TV down and rehang it.d) Level bubble is off do not rely on it and buy yourself a better one from another source.e) Overall the the mount is sturdy and cheap compared to retail but there are issues that need to be dealt with.f) No way to get exact height off the mantel for the TV/Mount so it was a trial and error.Worked to hang a 65 lbs Sony 55"" 3D TV no major issues hooking it up besides those listed above, unhooking the TV was an issue because I needed to rehang it lower once the fireplace was redone.",0,Negative
Level worthless. Don't trust it. Gauge of metal way sturdy enough for large panel TV installs. If you hit the studs right you can get away with using just one section of this mount.,0,Negative
"4/5 stars:I just used this product to mount a Panasonic TC-P55GT50 55-Inch Plasma. After hanging the TV there was still +/- a few inches to slide the TV on the wall bracket for proper centering. All the hardware provided seemed adequate for the job. I used the longer set of bolts and plastic spacers included in the kit so the TV was a little further from the wall. The shorter bolts would probably have worked without the spacers. I used my own level when mounting the bracket to the wall but discovered when I finally hung the TV that it still wasn't perfectly level. The problem was fixed by inserting a single piece of cardboard between one side of the hooks and the wall bracket. The final install seems solid and I didn't notice any vibration in the TV caused by my subwoofer aimed at the same wall.1 star Update:Purchased another VideoSecur mount only to discover Amazon is no longer selling the same model. The new model (MP502B)Is made more cheaply and has a two peace instead of a one peace wall bracket. I needed to replace the two swivel brackets which attach to the TV because the previous set were attached to a TV that was stolen. The new swivel brackets are too small to fit on the old single-piece bracket still mounted to my wall. THE REAL PROBLEM: Amazon simply transferred all the old reviews and information to this new model and only recently posted a new picture. Moreover, they even replaced the  picture of the older model in my account history with the new 502B. Oh, and they increased the suggested retail price in case you think the new model isn't a good enough deal.",0,Negative
"I bought this wall mount last week and have it installed in my living room. I have a 50"" Samsung LCD TV. The mount itself is quite sturdy, and so I would have given it a ""5 stars"" if not for the trouble I had during the installation. Simply put, because of the limited space behind the wall mount, and because my TV is so large, it was quite difficult to set it in place and screw the bottom two to clamp down the TV (I constantly scraped my knuckles onto the wall as I twisted and turned to get my screwdriver in there). And as some others have posted, its a good idea to plug in the wires into the TV before installing it. It's on the wall now, and it looks good, but if I had to do it again, I might pay a little bit more for a little bit more room in the back...and so for those with larger TV's, beware of the lack of space in the back...",2,Negative
"This was a really nice, and sturdy mount.  I used it to mount my Sharp 60"" LCD-LED TV.  I only have 2 real criticisms:First, when screwed together (the back-plate comes in two parts, which must be connected)  The mounting holes that were the widest apart was just under 32 inches.  In my particular situation,  I had a stud in the center, and then could only catch one either to the left or the right.  I would have preferred it just slightly wider, and I could have spread my mounting holes farther apart.Second, once the TV is hanging on the mount, and you are trying to screw in the set screws (so that the TV won't jump off the mount), you had better have either really small hands, or a very long screwdriver.  If you tried tilting the TV back, it lifted the bottom off the rack, thereby preventing you from screwing in the set screws.  I wound up using several long screw driver extensions, and more than a little bit of patience.Otherwise, the mount is great.  I'd have given it a 5 just on value alone, but the two criticisms knocked my rating down to a 4.All in all, I would buy this mount again!",2,Negative
"I purchased this mount based on the price and the reviews.  I could not be happier.  With my Prime account, paid no shipping.  Delivered in two days.  The mounting plate is heavy duty steel.  Product is rated to 165 lbs.  I just bought a Samsung 59"" Plasma that weighs between 70-80 lbs.  This mount is more than capable of supporting it.  The only extra I did was re-enforcing the mount's connection to the wall.  I mounted it on a 2x4 wall with 16oc studs.  I did not want to use the bolts or screws that came with the mount (also the packaged bubble lever is junk, don't use it).  I picked up new ones from Lowe's for a few bucks.  I also did not trust just using the stud screws to hold the mount to the wall.  I could access the other side of the wall from my garage, so I cut a hole through to the inside of the wall and set 4 2x4's, cut to size and laid flush against the wall board, in between the studs.  I then ran a carriage bolt through each 2x4 and secured with lock washers and nuts.  Now instead of the weight supported at four points it is supported at eight.  I only did this because of the heavier plasma screen.  If it was LED or even LCD, the extra support probably would have been unnecessary.Even at WalMart, a similar mount was over $100.  Don't waste your money on anything else.  This is all you need.",0,Negative
"This mount is very sturdy and yes I am talking about the mount where the back plate comes in 2 pieces that bolt together. In the photo there is a plastic insert that covers the seam in the two plates. Make sure you have a good level and you will have good results - I don't trust the dinky level that is included the the box. When mounting the back plane to the wall, don't forget to use the washers that come with the lag screws as the heads of the screws are smaller than I would have preferred. A socket wrench will make short work of driving these lag screws.I should deduct one half star because the security screws that keep the TV from being accidentally removed from the mount are very hard to reach. In my case, there was not enough room for my hand to get between the 60&#34; TV and the wall to tighten these important screws. My solution was to go out and buy at 12&#34; screw driver extension which enabled me to reach the screws from the bottom. On the plus side, without this extension tool, the TV will be very hard to get off the wall, so tighten them down snugly. My last TV was stolen by a couple of meth addicts who worked on getting my TV off the wall for what had to have been a half hour. The cops caught the scum bags.The included HDMI cable makes this an excellent value and make no mistake the bolted together back plane is very rigid when you get it screwed into the studs. I have no doubt that this mount could hold a 100 pound TV forever.",0,Negative
"I bought this based off of the reviews saying it was easy to install.  I hate putting things together that come in a bunch of pieces, so when I opened this, I thought it was going to be a little more difficult than people stated in the reviews.  It actually was really simple to put together, they just give you a bunch of screw sizes so it will work on different TVs.  I had it put together and a 47"" TV mounted in about 20 minutes.  Very sturdy too.  I'm impressed!",2,Negative
"I purchased this to hang my Panasonic VIERA TC-L55DT50 55-Inch on the wall.  The bracket advertises TVs up to 70&#34;, so my TV would be fine.  The bracket is like many others, but the one major difference was the lack of spacer options.  The bracket had the correct screw size for my TV, but the screw was too long without the spacers and too short with the spacers.  I had to buy some flat washers at my local hardware store to snug the fit.  It was not as good as other more expensive brackets, but my TV is on the wall with only moderate aggravation.",0,Negative
This worked out with some adjustments boy does it ever have to be perfectly level to have a tv up that just doesn't look rediculous crooked as hell.,0,Negative
"Arrived fast via UPS. Easy to hang, comes with multiple screws for the back of your television and multiple screws to attach to your wall, some for studs, others for sheet rock. I still can't believe how inexpensive this was!  T.V. on the wall in half an hour. Kit has two levels too, one integrated into the wall bracket and a separate one. The extra cable is a plus, considering some sell for the entire price of this kit.",0,Negative

"This is a well built unit. I am using it to hold a heavy (90 plus pounds) plasma TV on the wall and it is doing a fine job. Installation was simple and fast. One problem that I did experience is that the little lever to fix the tilt angle made it impossible to tighten if I did not need any tilt. I un-winded and winded it many times but it will always lock at an angle that was protruding too far out. I had to modify the design by using some bolts and screws as I did not want any tilt at all. Other than that, It is a fine unit.",0,Negative
This is a real good buy for this product. It came with more stuff that it said it would. At first I was kind of scared that it was going to fall off of my wall with my new plasma. My plasma weighed 104lbs and i still think about it sometimes but i guess that just me it never gave or bent or broke.,0,Negative
I can't say enough about this product especially for the price. I Had my 42inch plasma up on the wall I. About 30 minutes. Straight forward instructions and the built in level made it a breeze to install. This is by no means a cheap inferior product to what you find in the big box retailers. It is just simply cheaper!  I was skeptical at first but after receiving and installing and now after about 2 months no issues what so ever.,4,Negative
"If you buy this, DON'T USE THE BUILT IN LEVELER.  I did and had to take it down, as it was slanted.  Use your own leveler, this one is JUNK.  Crap product, big waste of time and unnecessary holes in the wall.  Buy a different brand, there are many to choose from on Amazon.",0,Negative

"Don't spend any more $$ for a TV mount than this.  I mounted this to my studs and picked myself (180 lbs) up by the wall brackets before I hung the TV, no flex and no issues.  Screws that come with it for the TV are a little suspect (cheap), I would suggest using loctite to ensure they don't back out.",0,Negative
"I bought this item to mount a 40"" Samsung LED TV. It was relatively easy to mount. As other reviewers suggested, I used my own level and didn't rely on the built in one. My only problem was that I needed to use the spacers which came with the mount to attach the tv to the rails. With the spacers, the screws were too short to attach the tv to the rails, thus an inconvenient trip to the hardware store was necessary before I could finish the job. The product seems very sturdy and the price is right. I would buy it again.",4,Negative
"i purchased this for my 70&#34; sharp aquos which weighs 75-80 pounds. the mount came with a variety of standard hardware and they included a small level. the mount's wall plate comes in 2 sections. you put the two sections together and than mount it to the wall. because of how the wall studs are 16 inches apart, i could only mount into 2 studs due to the length of the wall plate. i added 2 more sections of drywall mounting just in chase because of the size of the tv. as said, there is a variety of standard hardware included. the screws that mount the brackets to the tv were the right size circumference but one set was short and one set was too long. easy fix was a trip to lowes to get the exact length screws for under $2. i am not crazy about the design of the tilt mechanism. i do not want to install my tv to tilt at all. the tightening mechanism to hold the tilt/anti tilt in place can get in the way if you are not careful when actually installing the tv onto the bracket. this can be potentially dangerous. i had to play with mechanism so it would not get in the way in it's tightest position. i had to purchase and extra extra long screw driver to tighten the screws of the bracket from below after wall installation. otherwise, you can't get to it because of the size of the tv. overall it is sturdy and doing the job and nothing beats having a large led tv on a wall vs having it on a stand. looks a lot cleaner as long as you run the wires through the wall. i pre measured exactly where on the wall the tv was supposed to mount and then pre cut an access panel hole in the drywall which i can access from the adjacent room. otherwise it would be impossible to access and change your connections on the tv once mounted.",0,Negative
"Very good mount! it came with many different bolts and accessories in different sizes, I mounted my 60 inch LG Plasma TV with no problem!! Solid as a brick!!",4,Negative
"Ok, so if it wasn't for the fact that the TV HAD to get mounted the day I was available to do it, the mount would have gone back.The wall plate consists of TWO 16"" long plates that are supposed to be bolted together with 10-32 screws then the entire bracket is mounted to the wall with four lag screws..... IF the stud location vs where you want the TV centered don't line up exactly, then mount could buckle where the tiny screws hold it together.I was lucky in that I could get away with using ONE plate due to odd locations of studs.Now for the really insane part. Once the tv is on the mount and you have it tilted where you like it, you can't access the locking screws on the lower half of the mount! The fix is to use a really small tv (under 42"") or use spacers to push the TV forward on the mount so that when it's tilted there is more room behind it. Well both of those answers stink.I have used tilting mounts before and had NO issues with access to the lower screws.This is just a cheap mount that stinks. There are much better mounts for the same price out there. Please buy one of those B4 thinking of this one.",0,Negative

"While this is a solidly built unit, it was of no use to me.  My 32"" Panasonic has its mounting screw holes 3 15/16"" apart; the holes on the mount mismatch by 9/32"" in either direction.  A well-designed mount would have some elongated mounting holes to allow for this, but on this one all the holes are circular and have equal spacing.",2,Negative
"Pretty simple to mount and surprisingly sturdy for the price! Comes with about 2 dozen extra bolts you won't need, but it WILL likely have the size you DO need! It's a low profile mount, so for others complaining about the lack of room behind their mounted tv's, that's the idea! It's not supposed to be hanging a foot off the wall people!",2,Negative

"Out of the box and onto the wall. All instructions unnecessary. Item is extremely sturdy. Have owned this mound well over a year and have placed it in three different locations. No problems at all.

"I used this to hang a 19"" LCD on a wood framed interior wall.  No problems with the install. Needed to drill pilot holes for the lag bolts the anchor to the wall.

"While these are not quite the 20&#34; extension they claim to be (more like 19&#34;) they are solid and have no trouble handling my 27&#34; widescreen's.  They are quite stiff at the adjustment points, I had to back off the bolts with a wrench (the little nut adjustment tool they send you is about useless) just to get the monitor into position, though one reviewer said they loosen up with use.  Also, if you leave the adjustment bolts loose the monitor will sag and end up with a pitch (right or left,) someone had said that there wasn't any adjustment for pitch, but there is a little adjustment if you undo the Vesa screws on the back of the monitor and adjust the plate.  Either way I'm quite happy with them for the price; I bought three for a triple monitor setup.  I'll update if anything goes bad.",0,Negative
"Very heavy duty and works well.  I have this installed with a 22"" HDTV and it holds it's position and is fine.Maybe its obvious to some but this installs with 6 lag bolts and you need a ratchet and not just screws like I first thought.  Its still not hard but its a little more complicated than just grabbing the cordless drill and putting a couple screws in like expected.One tip, you can remove the mounting plate by taking out the one bolt so you don't have to hold the entire heavy thing up while your mounting it to the wall like the directions say.  This also makes it easier to attach the TV.  Then you can just lift it and connect it back together with just the one bolt.",2,Negative
This product is as advertised. The only downside was the packaging. There were some hidden damage to the top shelf; could be packaged a little better to avoid this problem in shipping.,4,Negative
"I don't know how they do it, but they do. I have a 60&#34; LG plasma TV that weighs a ton. Okay it weights about 85lbs.

It wasn't going anywhere...Anxiously put the TV up on it... and dreaded a creak or crash... it's been over a month and it's still standing strong.I have the LG 60&#34; Plasma, and I got the 40-70&#34; (weight limit of 220lbs) mount to play it safe.",0,Negative
"The other comments are pretty accurate with instructions, alignment issues, and missing screws.  What is a pain is that everything is metric in MM and being in America everything is standards.

I have the Bello cabinet and it attaches just fine and had no issues. The Installation says to check you TV manufacture for the mounting instructions. Well, my sharp TV does not have the instructions. There are several permutations on who to attach to a TV and I had to spend quite a bit of time figuring this out. Once I did it was a pain to tighten screws properly because of positioning.",0,Negative

"It's a very good looking and sturdy shelf and it's much larger than it looks in the picture. It does seem to take a lot more work than I was expecting to mount. However, you can also configure it in numerous ways, so it makes up for it.FYI - I was able to mount it above the TV with the wires going down through the channel, despite all of the picutres and instructions only showing it below a TV.After getting the first one for the living room, I ordered another for the bedroom. I suppose I found it to be such a pain because I had to mount them 10 feet in the air while standing on a ladder. The overly complex mounting procedure is really bad for trying to do that.",3,Negative
"I took off one star simply because the instruction manual has too many misprints. In fact, when I called OmniMount over the phone, the associate admitted that there were printed errors. The errors mainly point towards using a metal washer on glass (which is a big no no). Your typical customer might follow these directions and destroy the unit. Reading the instructions isn't easy. Explanations are too vague, one worded, and it will have you constantly calling in making sure you don't make a mistake.Other than that, this shelf is pretty awesome.",0,Negative

CONS:1. Must Attach to a stud - this means that it will likely not center underneath a TV depending on the layout of your room.2. No consideration for actually hiding wires for devices on the shelf2a. I used a forstner bit to drill a hole to hold the wires - MODIFICATIONS NEEDEDPROS:1. Inexpensive2. Easy to drill into plastic if you have the tools,1,Negative
"I don't really enjoy this product. I thought it would be nice and convenient to hide the wires coming out of my LG 42&#34; HDTV, but it's a very strange sized product. Putting it together was easy enough, but placing it on the wall is kind of difficult. Sure, you can make the neck really long if you want your Cable box/etc close to the ground, but that's not very aesthetically pleasing. Generally, an ideal viewing height does not work really well with this product. I have my TV at about 6', meaning that the bottom of the TV is closer to 3'. This product ends up going from 1'-3' because it's so long. So my cable box just sit on a piece of glass right above the floor. I don't like it. Plus, it's a lot wider/deeper than you think. It's not really as sleek as the pictures suggest. The product is essentially a huge piece of glass and a bunch of plastic/metal. I just don't love how functional it is.",2,Negative

"I've used these time and again when mounting tv's for my customers. The price is right. They are sleek and stylish. I'm not even a fan of glass shelves, but the smoked glass gives it a very slim look. It's sized right and sturdy to boot! No complaints here!",1,Negative
Pros:1. Nice looking.2. Hides cables well.Cons:1. Front of shelf tilts noticeably toward floor. Had to put some washers in the bottom of shelf to level it up.2. Unstable. Tilts side-to-side after installation.3. Shelf could be a little larger. My components sit on or very near the edge.4.

This shelf is OK for knick knacks but not stereo/home theater components.  The shelves are way too small.  Even my DVR which is not that big barely fits.

"Bought this for an Xbox 360 under a wall-mounted TV.1. Subpar instructions. Half-dozen languages all squeezed in one small book. Expect to put it together looking at the pictures.2. Unreasonable to expect people to secure the mount with the provided Philip screws using a Phillips screwdriver. I predrilled with a 1/8"" bit into a wall stud as instructed. I drilled a bit deeper than the instructions specified. It was still a struggle to screw the Philip screws without stripping them. I ended up using a socket wrench with a Phillips bit to tighten the screws. The additional torque made it easy but without it I'm not sure I could have done it.3. Shelf tilts slightly down along the front. It's difficult to notice but it does after I checked with a level. The shelf can also tilt slightly to one side if you don't check before tightening the shelf bracket to the mount.For $30 it's ok.",0,Negative
Good quality product especially for the price. I originally installed it with the shelf thinking I would use the shelf but when I got it up it just looked funny. Kind of defeated the purpose of hanging the TV on the wall. Shelf does stick out quit a bit. So I just use the cable management without the shelf. Easy to install.,3,Negative

"This mount works great, as long as you have the perfect location and components. Fortunately we did. We installed this in our bedroom where it sits under our wall-mounted LCD TV, and above a dresser. My Sony A/V receiver sits on the dresser (underneath the lower shelf of the mount). On the shelves sit a cable box, Blu-Ray, and xbox. There are a lot of cords going up through the cable management system (4 HDMI and 4 power cables), and I didn't really have any problem. The cable management system worked really well. I'm surprised by other reviewers saying they had trouble getting their cords to fit.Some caveats:* If you have larger components, they may not fit well on the shelves. My equipment listed above is all newer and fairly small. My full-size Sony receiver would never have fit, especially not enough to allow the cables coming out the back.* We still ended up with a mess of cables BELOW the mount. Again, in our case these are hidden by a dresser, but it would look terrible if this were hung by itself in a room. (I think it might be possible to by additional cable management channel that you can add underneath. Not sure how good that would look.)Bottom line: decent mount for the price as long as your situation is similar to mine.",3,Negative
Much cheaper than the mounts available at the usual electronic stores.  Sturdy.  The one I have has three components sitting on it with no worry.  Looks like quality as well.,4,Negative
"I bought this swing-arm LCD TV mount from another on-line vendor, and it arrived scratched and missing hardware.  Numerous phone calls to the vendor and manufacturer resulted in offers to replace the unit, but only after I returned the one I received.  This is, as I'm sure most of you are aware, unlike Amazon, which has sent out replacements before receiving the returned merchandise.I noted that the packing material used to protect the painted surfaces did not surround the arms and mounting base, so in transit, they are able to bump against each other and that could be the source of the scratches.Harware missing was 2 metric screws, which are not easy to find in a local hardware store.  Someone had opened the sealed plastic envelope, removed the screws and resealed the envelope with transparent tape.All-in-all, this wasn't a pleasant experience and neither the retailer or the manufacturer took any responsibility for the problem, meaning someone else might get a similarly defective unit.Buyer beware!",0,Negative
"I have owned three different projector mounts and this Peerless is the best by far.  I understand Chief mounts are good too but from what I understand they do not have the ease of adjustment.  I am using this mount on my JVC RS40.  This is a monster home theater projector and weighs 33lbs.  Out of the box this mount works fine.  What is interesting is that Peerless customer service said this universal mount will not work.  I don't know why they would say that.  The mount is rated for a 50lbs projector and the specs indicate the arms with reach all four mounting holes on the JVC - and it does.  So what is up with Peerless customer service?  I found out this mount works by reading reviews on the AVS web site and confirming the specs.  I highly recommend this mount.  It is expensive, but the quality and ease of adjustment are worth it/critical IMHO.  You need to square the projector with the screen and the adjustment design of this mount make it a breeze.  The problem I had with other mounts is that once set, they wouldn't hold, the projector wandered, just slightly... but enough to mess with the picture.  The other mounts were a pain attach the projector on, not the Peerless - lifting a $3K, 33 lb projector on a ladder is not fun.Is this the only part you'll need?  Probably not... It was for me as I used parts of my prior ceiling mount and drop down.  You can use this mount to attach directly to the ceiling, in that case it is all you need.  The drop down tube (pipe) is a standard thread 1 1/2 inch.  You can use PVC pipe and it attaches fine, I tried it.  No, not as strong as steal but I think it would be fine for 35 to 100lbs? So basically there are three parts to buy in a drop down style, the mount, the drop down tube, and the ceiling bracket that attaches to the drop down tube.  I hope this review helps, I highly recommend this mount even though the cost seems high it works great!",0,Negative
"Great product. Unlike the disastrous PRS-UNV, whose adjustment screws never got tight enough to hold the PJ in one place, this mount is bomb-proof. The geared mechanisms that control pitch and roll are high-quality and stay put.",1,Negative
"very stable when install, also the screws are too long and I had to change them (or kill myself trying to put the all lenght). being my first experience with home theatre, I belive this piece is very important to make sure that any adjustment will stand. and this one is very solid/stable",1,Negative
"The one I got must have been a defect given the high reviews of this mounting bracket.The bolt holes in the telescopic part did not line up perfectly in mine, they were about 1/8"" or less off but more than enough to prevent the bolts from being used. I ended up re-drilling the hole to cut out the excess metal blocking the hole.Otherwise the bracket was great.",0,Negative
"I love this TV mount. I've seen mounts like this in restaurants and figured I should be able to pick up one somewhere. Low and behold Amazon had it. The weight it can hold is awesome but considering TV's are bigger and lighter than ever this mount will never reach its maximum 110lbs. I also have a vaulted ceiling and this mount had no problem attaching and making the TV level. Plus it has all the adjustments you could want. Panning, tilt on the mount, move the arm forwards/backwards, and a height adjustment to raise or lower the tv from the ceiling. So much versatility at a fraction what some other mounts cost.",0,Negative
"I did not measure the connector locations on back of TV. BIG mistake. I could not use this bracket as is. Lucky for me, the mounting wall is a closet so I cut a hole inside closet so I can reach thru and plug in the RF and HDMI connectors AFTER sliding the TV onto this mount.Not a fault of the mount, but......",0,Negative
"This really isn't a knock on the product, but I didn't account for the plugs in the back of the TV needing room. Even with a deep set wall outlet the plug from my monitor sticks out about 2 inches. If you really need a flat mount then this would probably work. Construction is solid. Not really worth returning for the 15 bucks i spent on it.",2,Negative
"Fits nicely on my monitor (27&#34; Yamakasi Catleap)I wanted it for an ambient lighting mod im doing, and needed a way to mount plexi-glass on the back of my monitor! And this bad boy did just that.Had to get some different hardware for mounting the second piece to the glass but no biggie it wasn't built for that anyways, plus it was like $2 at the local shop.",3,Negative
"I purchased this for 24"" Dell LCD computer monitors. It's quite heavy duty and worked well but there was one issue. The back of the Dell monitor had a deep recess where the brackets were going to be attached. To accommodate this, I had to put four hex nuts under the bracket before I screw the bracket onto the back of the monitor. Fortunately they included screws in several different lengths with the bracket so I was still able to attach the bracket. It's not the fault of the manufacture of this bracket, but I think the industry should standardize the depth of the recess where the brackets are attached.",0,Negative
"I bought this to mount a Vizio 22 inch flat screen in my kitchen. Because the location was a wall with a 180 degree view, I wanted a mount with the smallest profile possible and this mount only puts the TV about half an inch off the wall.  It is not adjustable as far as tilting goes, and that was also fine for the application.The mount is very solid construction and a straight forward installation. There is more hardware than you will need. One bracket screws to the back of the TV, and the second bracket screws into the wall. You then just slide the TV into the bracket. There was only one tricky part for my particular installation. Because the mount is so low profile, when you connect your coax cable, ac adaptor, etc., to the back of the set, you cannot slide it into position - the cables protrude further out the back than the half inch space provides. We solved this problem by cutting a 6 inch x 1 inch channel into the wall so the problem cable had enough space slide the wall as the TV was mounted. Another option would have been to install a recess box into the wall. The one I saw at Home Depot cost more than three times what I paid for this mount (my option of cutting into the wall was free).",0,Negative
"For under ten bucks this is an amazing product. It works perfectly!The quality is solid and the design is simple. There's only two pieces. One slides into the other. You mount one plate on the wall with 4 screws and the other plate gets screwed to the monitor with 4 included screws.The package comes with 3 sets of machine screws in different sizes for mounting the other plate to the screen - so the screws you need for this will probably be included in one of those sets.The whole thing is very slim - the back of the screen mounts about 5/8"" away from the wall - that's just about the closest you could possibly expect with any mount.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1,Negative
"This is an excellent mounting bracket for VESA mountable TVs and Monitors.  This thing gets your TV as close to the wall as you could ever reasonably expect.  Keep in mind that you will not be able to use any rear ports if you use this bracket.The only thing that was an issue for me is that I can not figure out how to get the locking screws in...I can not find a screwdriver skinny enough to fit.  I have a really long Phillips, but the shaft of the driver is too thick.  I have not seen one any thinner than the one I tried.  Maybe the problem is the way my TV is shaped.At any rate, it's holding as-is so I still give this bracket 5 stars.",0,Negative
"Simple, lightweight, no angle adjustment, very close to wall. TV side and wall side lock together with two screws when installed correctly.  Mount and TV are snug to the wall and standup to the constant vibration when the RV is in motion. Best used when no viewing angle adjustments are needed.",2,Negative
I got this for my 21' LED TV in my bedroom. The wall mount itself works great but I would reconsider this one if you have a TV with the connections on the back. My tv has all of the connections on the back of it so I had to add some spacers to get it to work without the cords being a problem. I eventually took it off and put the TV back on the stand though that was mainly because I didn't feel like re hanging the mount when we moved the bedroom around.,3,Negative
"You really can't beat this mount at this price for the simplicity and solid mounting it provides. If you have no need for adjustments, this is the one to get.",4,Negative
This is a heavy duty and simple monitor mount. I wanted a mount that does not angle the monitor in any direction which is what this mount does.  This was not clear from the pics or description but is exactly what I was looking for.,2,Negative
"It is what it says. If you dont need a tilt function and a VESA 75 is all you need, It's a steal",4,Negative
"This mount is wide enough so that there's no way you dont hit studs where you need them, better if you have new construction and can block the wall for the mount. Anyway, this is a good mount, simple to get up on the wall, and the folks at Omnimount send you more hardware than you need for any possible application so you're good to go.One major caution though....if you dont plan to tilt your new Plasma/LCD, then you need to ratchet down the tilt mechanism as tight as you can get it so that the weight of your tv doesnt pull it down at an angle after you get it up on the wall. My 58"" Panasonic dropped twice and I was forced to take the damn thing down and crank the Allen wrench as tight as I could possibly get it to hold the thing up vertical. Somewhat of a pain. All in all a good mount.",0,Negative
"The mount as pictured has the a larger metal plate toward the TV end.  This is pre-installed on the arm with five screws that are supposed to tighten or loose using an Allen wrench.  These screws afford adjustment of a few degrees to keep the TV perfectly horizontal.For packaging reasons, these screws are already bolted on with a spring washer.  So it has a lot of tension.  To mount, one must first remove these screws to lighten the weight when mounting on the wall.However, these screws may have been over-tightened.  And some of them simply won't come off.  If you use enough torque, the hex receptor would just give to become a round hole, rendering them completely impossible to remove.  It might also have to do with the material of these screws, as they might have been made from cheap aluminium, instead of galvanized alloy.The first item that I received had one of the screws un-removable.  For some reason, I couldn't request a replacement.  So I returned it and ordered another one.  It came with two of the screws un-removable.I gave Amazon credit for covering for the return shipping, but the hassle of having to return them becomes insufferable.  Not to mention the fact that I wasted more time before I can mount my TV permanently.Unless you lift weight for a living and can expect to mount the whole thing perfectly level at the first go, you would be very disappointed in its quality.",0,Negative
"I bought this mount and there was no installation guide or manual, I have sent at least 6 e-mails to the company and I have not received any response from sales department or customer care, this only means that the company is not serious and they do not care and do not have CUSTOMER CARE, seems that they only want to sell products that does not have enough quality.  It is not easy to install and more ""without an installation manual or guide"", It took me 5 to 6 hours.  I have a 55 inch sony lcd TV. I had to buy different screws for the back of this TV, because the mount comes with different screws and not the necessary for this model. The mount comes with 4 screws for wood or concrete use, but ""4 are not enough""  I put 6 (4 included in the box) and after a week the tv almost fell infront of me, It was a nightmare. I dont think this mount is appropriate for a 55"" inch TV and I do not think seller have made enough tests This TV is too heavy for this mount.",0,Negative
"It does its job in that it holds the TV up, but it has this strange tilt downward. I wanted this TV screen to be parallel to the wall, but it tilts downward. I'm disappointed but it's already been installed so I'm not going to go through the trouble of uninstalling etc.",0,Negative
"I bought this for a 58&#34; TV which weighs 101.5 lbs.  The mount could not support the TV, and it pointed downward towards the floor.The manufacture's paper work which comes with the product, states it has a maximum 55&#34; capacity.I also found other links on the web which also states this modal has a 55&#34; TV max capacity.When i complain to seller about manufacture's documented max size not matching seller's description of (32-65&#34;), the seller stated that newer TV's are lighter, and that the manufacture set the 55&#34; limit based on older heavier TV's.I looked around to see if I could find a new 65&#34; TV online with weight specification of less then 101.5 pounds, and I could not find any.This leads me to conclude that this mount can not support 65&#34; TV.This product is not even listed in the Cheetah main web site anymore, and I have to believe it's not listed because it doesn't even meet the 55&#34; maximum size requirement, let alone 65&#34;.Don't buy this unless you like giving away your money.",0,Negative
"Had no problem to install, however I didn't follow the instructions completely since that would require 2 persons.Good heavy construction,  very pleased with result.",4,Negative
"This is a handy little TV mount.  The only gripe (and this is echoed with others) is that depending on where and how you use this mount, you may end up with some slight tilt to the TV.  This isn't a big problem if you just leave the TV in one place as you can adjust it once and leave it, but if you're constantly repositioning, you may find the few degrees of tilt slightly frustrating.",2,Negative
"I saw it start to sag from the weight of a 50"" Panasonic Plasma so I took it off the wall.  I might trust this with an LCD of 50"" but a Plasma because of weight.  It is a heavy duty looking product, but if you read the reviews closely, you will find that it does not inspire confidence in heavier plasmas.",2,Negative
"This is the second tv mount I have installed.  The good things about this mount is that it is heavy and sturdy and extends quite far, but there are several problems with it.  The first is that when folded in, the center of the larger plate that the TV mounts to is not in the center of the plate that attaches to the wall. So if you center the wall plate on your wall, your TV will not be in the center! This is not mentioned anywhere in the instructions.  Luckily I noticed this before installing, but it makes it more difficult to install since you need to find studs off center with where you want the TV. In my case I had to mount the plate as far to the right as I could and then hang the TV as far to the left as it could go to get the TV centered.  Also, in order to do this I had to mount it upside down. It does not actually say which is the top and which is the bottom, but the pictures all show it one way.  It appears symetric except the bolts that hold the joints of the arm face one way but I didn't think it was an issue to have them up rather than down as the pictures showed.The next main problem is that after mounting the wall plate level, I found that the arm is not level.  Even before hanging the TV the arm is not parallel or level with the back plate.  Now you can level the piece that mounts to the TV with an allen wrench, but because the arms are not level as you extend the arms and turn them different directions the level changes.  In one direction the right side will be too high and in another the left side will be high. This is just bad quality.The next issue I had is that the TV can not be made level vertically.  At the highest adjustment it still tilts down towards the floor.  After looking at it more I think it may be because I installed it ""upside down"".  It seems that the plate itself that the TV mounts to is not vertically level.  If I mounted it the other way it would actually be tilted up which would allow me to level the TV.The final gripes are that you should be able to lock the TV in place on the plate.  Instead it can always slide left to right which it sometimes does when I am pulling it out and angling it.  Finally, the joints of the arms are very stiff.  I had to loosen the bolts slightly to make it a little more reasonable.  Even so it takes a lot of force to pull them out so that I am worried about the force on the TV and my wife would probably not be able to do it herself.",2,Negative
"I had some doubts initially but finally I went for it and no regrets at all, this is a very solid piece of hardware to which you can attach you TV with no concerns. Great stuff.",3,Negative
"I bought a 32 inch flat screen hoping this would work. I got the bigger size so I could upgrade to a bigger tv if I wanted to. Right when I got it I started assembling it with the help of my dad. After mounting on the wall, we soon realize that there is a picture on the instructions of a very important piece that it necessary in holding up your tv but it never came with one!! We checked the ""whats in the box"" section and we had all the bolts and pieces it said it came with. It didn't even include the important piece!!! We had to go to the store and buy some washers and bolts and make do ourselves! Then once it was mounted on I wanted to plug in my Xbox but soon found out that I could not put in the prongs (yellow white and red) because the back of the stand blocks it! And lastly it is very VERY difficult to turn and move around. Even after a month of playing with it. It still is very difficult. Do not buy this!!!",3,Negative
I WARN you do not buy this item it is not for a 60 in. Tv.it can not hold the weight.It came with a broken screw.The swivel arm was bentmechanics was paid to do nothing since this cheetah mounts was unreliable and no sturdy.  I repeat do not buy. You've been warned!,2,Negative

"THIS IS A STURDY MOUNT HAD A 42 AND 46 INCH TV ON IT, THE ONLY PROBLEM IS, IS THAT THE I COULD ONLY USE THE PLUG INS ON THE SIDE OF THE TV BECAUSE THE BACK OF THE TV WAS BLOCKED BY THE MOUNT. OTHER THAN THAT NO COMPLAINTS.",2,Negative
The lightest of any wall mount that I have installed.The arms are cheap as well as the tilt.The first wall mount that I could pick with one hand.The tilt is cheap and you can not get your hand in to loosen the arm which gets stuck in the bracket.Because of the price I thought it would be heavy duty.I would never buy this item again.,0,Negative

"I don't have a lot of experience with installing tv wall mounts but as far as I could tell it was pretty cut and dry... simple. I installed an LG LED 42"" 5300. The most difficult part was holding it up while installing the main lag bolts into the 2x4 stud. The beast weighs 25+ pounds. Thankfully an extra pair of hands came to help just in time. One thing that was slightly annoying was that when the tv was tilted fully down and placed along the tv mount plate just so, the brackets that attach to the tv rest against the nuts that adjust the tv rotation and make it sit crooked. BTW you do have to tighten them after your install. They come loose from the manufacturer to adjust for the droop due to the weight of the tv when fully extended. Minimal at worst but noticeable none the less. The last beef I have is that once installed it is difficult to move the tv in and out from the wall. I find it necessary to move using the mount itself instead of putting stress on the tv. As a final test I decided to hang my weight on it... a whopping 130 pounds. With only two lag bolts in the studs it held up just peachy. :D",2,Negative
"Appears to be sturdy enough while assembly but outer TV mounting interface is small thin angle with bolted connection in the center (bows when weight is applied).  This along with the slop in the moving fixture left my 65&#34; TV sagging 8-10 inches, plasma TV is about 80 lbs.  No way this can hold up to 165 lbs.",2,Negative
Took about an hour or so to get it all together and up.  It will take time to fine tune the tilt adjustments and get it all square when the tv is on.  But I have a 55inch samsung and no issues so far after a month of use.,0,Negative
This came with every bit of hardware needed to put it on the wall. It's been there working for quite a while. Can't say any better than that.,2,Negative
"If you properly install the mount to the studs, there is no reason to spend $200 on a mount. I did apply WD-40 to the hinges before installing, and over a year later, it still swivels with a one handed push. I have a 42 inch panasonic on it and it is still very sturdy and level. Proper cord management is needed to take advantage of the full range.",0,Negative
"It is rated to 160lbs. However. Once the installers connected it to the back of the TV, it sagged visibly. The problem is a flimsy plate that holds the tv. I cannot imagine how this can possibly hold 160lbs. I think it's suitable for little more than a large computer monitor.Total waste of time & money. And now my return window has expired so I'm stuck with this piece of junk.",0,Negative
"The wall mount is very sturdy and well built, but as other reviewers have said the bolts and bushings which allow the arms to pivot are very cheap and allow the whole mount to torque and twist when you try to move the TV.  I have a relatively light 55"" LED and the whole mounts twists when moving the TV - defiantly would not recommend this for the much heaver plasma TV's.  The instruction manual is very poorly written and the directions are confusing.  The wall plate that bolts to the wall will only fit standard 16"" stud spacing - so don't bother with this mount if you have anything non standard.  Also, the picture clearly shows cable holes in the wall plate - mine came with no such holes.  The only way I could get the cables around the wall plate was to drill another hole in my wall above the wall plate to snake the cables through.Pros:1. Sturdy BuildCons:1. Hard to Move TV Once it's Mounted2. Only Fits Standard 16"" Stud Spacing3. Cheap Bolt & Bushings4. Poor Instruction Manual5. No Hole in Wall Plate for Cables",2,Negative
I had read at least 20 reviews before I decided to buy this wall mount. I could not be more pleased. Prices at the stores are at least three times more expensive and the quality is not as great as this one.It is a great product. All hardware is available in the box and it is so much easy to install. I will buy another when I upgrade the TV at my room!,4,Negative
"While this is a sturdy mount the front plate where the TV hangs was not level resulting in the right side of my TV being an inch and half lower. I was able to offset this by lowering the bracket that attaches to the TV on that side one notch lower. It's still a little off, so I will probably ask for a replacement. Upon inspection, I can see where the problem was as the screws used to attached the arm to the front plate were not flush at all. I suggest to everyone to take a level to both the back and front plate and verify they are level before drilling any holes in your wall. For now 2 stars (for the poor quality control) until I hear back from Cheetah Mounts. Hopefully, they will do an advanced RMA and send me out a replacement as I left my TV on the mount for now (as I can deal with it being a little off.",0,Negative
"Honestly I expect to see the wall go before the mount gives in.  Easy to put together, all screws and bolts clearly marked.One little problem there is no mark or hole right in the middle of the mount. This is a little tricky, since at least I marked my mounting point absolute center of the wall, to find out I can not see it when mounting..... but two more measures and small dots on the outlinecovered that problem. The second small problems is the weight of the mount itself. I mounted it by myself, but a second set of hands would have been willingly accepted.Once it was mounted, I hung my whole 240 lbs on it and no move nothing. I dont think there are much sturdier solutions then this.And if there are what for?

"Challenging assembly, some parts seem a little light duty.  However, my 60&#34; seventy pound TV is still on the wall.

"Got this right before Christmas.  My husband hung it with no problems (even though it seemed really heavy to me and I knew I wouldn't be able to do it on my own...I have trouble with my back so I couldn't do it).  He didn't need any assistance other than lifting the t.v. onto the bracket once it was in place.  It's been really working out well since we have a rambunctious two year old who runs around the house and knocks into things.  That's why we wanted the t.v. on the wall so no chance of the t.v. toppling over off of the t.v. stand.  We have a 55 inch LG and the LG stand didn't really seem too sturdy. This bracket does what it intends.  The only thing I don't like is that to move the t.v. from side to side or out away from the wall, you have to hold the brackets behind the t.v. and pull that (instead of just grabbing the t.v. frame and moving that as needed).  It's a little awkward to move and for me, it's too hard to pull out and maneuver.  I always have to get my husband to pull it or whatever if I want it moved.  We just leave it in one position basically now and it's working well for us.  It you are an older person with not much strength or have trouble with your back or something, you may have trouble mounting this yourself and also maneuvering it after.  I still gave it 5 stars because it seems really well built (solid) and my husband easily followed the instructions to install it on the wall and mount the t.v.",2,Negative
"This mount is well built.  I had to mount a board on the wall since my studs are 24"" on center and the mount is made for 16"" on center.  I then installed the mount to the board.  I was able to bolt at least one side of the mount to the wall studs where it crossed them.  The other side is only bolted to the board, but it is very strong.  Enough to hold me at 235lbs.  This is how everything lined up for me in order to center it on my wall.  It's no problem holding up my vizio 55"".  I removed the lock washers and flat washers so the nuts had more of a bite on the bolts and the nylock will keep them from loosening up.  I dont know why they used both lock washers and nylock nuts buts its unnecessary.  I then tightened them up so that it was easy to move away from the wall but nott too loose.  A lot of people have complained about how hard it is to move the tv from the wall.  Just tweak the nuts and bolts till there is a little resistance and it will work great.",0,Negative
Had to rate this with 5 because 6 don't exist.  Love the expanding capability of this mount... so does she.  I would suggest installing extra studs in the wall along with better anchors if you attempt to reenact my suggestions.  just sayin,2,Negative
"Cheetah is the go to in mounts. Although I feel as if they are over made with very thick steel. This mount was a first for me due to its articulation. Ours hangs at an angle as well. We don't know why as everything is level but the TV sits lower on one side by about 1.5 inches. It seems to want to hang at an angle worse when pulled out. Our setup does not require it to be pulled out so this is not an issue. Make sure that the bolts and nuts are tightened on the mount prior to installing. This one also has no wire guides. Tip for Sheetrock/stud installers, do NOT over tighten the lag bolts. Over tightening will cause damage to your Sheetrock.I had originally had a rating of 4 stars given for the above review. Cheetah contacted me today to discuss the issues that I spoke about above. I am changing my rating to a 5 star simply because of them caring about their product and the willingness to correct ANY issue, no questions asked. I'm leaving the above review just for a help to others though.",0,Negative
The mount is very solid. I don't feel like the tv will fall of at all like I was worried like another mount I have. I don't like that the tilt adjustment tighteners are too close to the mount and cannot be used without the stand offs. Now I have to remove the tv from the wall and take off the mounts and them add the stand offs and put it al back again.,1,Negative
"Incredible waste of time. Tried to put a 46&#34; LCD, 66lbs, bent horribly and almost broke off. Will never buy anything from Cheetah again. Anyone with a tv greater than 30 lbs should avoid this like the plague. Now I have to reassemble this and send it back. Don't know who to trust anymore, when something is buried with 2000+ reviews, you need to look at the 1 stars to know what is reality and what is hype",0,Negative
This did just what I needed done.The ONLY reason I did not give 5 stars is because the lag bolts provided for mounting into the wall studs were of poor quality and the there were no bolts long enough to attach my 60&#34; screen to the frame. I went out and purchased better quality bolts for what was needed and was done with it.,2,Negative

"I am extremely happy with this mount.  Just be very careful as not to use the bubble levels that came with the product as other people have mentioned.  As for the installation I took apart the front panel (5 screws w/washers) because it made it lighter and easier to handle.  Then after figuring out where the mount was most centered between the two studs, I installed the first lag bolt then used my four foot level on the two arms attached to the base before bolting the second lag bolt.  Then I re-attached the front panel and used my level on that as well because it can be slightly adjusted for leveling purposes.  Then I hung the tv (after installing the two arms on the back of it first).  With just two bolts this mount was super sturdy.  When I was satisfied the TV was in the correct position I just took the tv off and bolted the last two lag bolts.The only thing I didn't like was the mechanism that controlled the tilt of the TV.  There were two sets of bolt for my TV included in this kit.  One set was too long, the other too short.  The short ones worked but made the tilting difficult.  I have to adjust the tilt with the tv off the mount.  If I had the proper size bolts, I could have used the spacers to make that mechanism work while the tv is mounted.  They should have made the end of it either slotted (for a screw driver) or have a nut on it and use a ratchet.  Instead it has a little lever with two balls attached at both ends and it hits the mount if the TV is hung (in my situation).  Not a deal breaker in any way and not worth removing a star in the review.",0,Negative
"Unit was a snap to install.  What I did was get the stud locations on the wall.  Predrilled one hole.As it is heavy, I held it vertically against the wall, screwed in the 1st lag into the stud, snug, not tight.Swung the bottom up to the horizontal position & checked the level.  Marked the 2nd hole.  Let the unit dangle down vertically as I predrilled the 2nd hole.Swung the unit back up horizontally, inserted the lag bolt into that stud, screwed it down snug.  Checked the level.  Adjusted the unit until the bubble was centered.  THEN, tighten down both lag bolts.No muss, no fuss.",0,Negative
"This is a very heavy duty mount and the only complaint is that the picture showed access holes in the mounting panel, but the panel is solid and I will have to have it punched. This could be a major problem for most folks",3,Negative
"The mount is specced to hold a 165 pound TV. It might hold that TV up, but it'll be pointing at the floor. With a 93 pound TV it's sagging to around 3 degrees down after only a few hours. If it gets much worse I'll be forced to take it down before a replacement (different brand of course) arrives.Also, the safety retention screws that prevent the TV from accidentally pivoting off the mount didn't work in their pre-stripped holes in the mount. I was able to remedy that by using my own M6 nuts to fasten them.Overall, I don't trust my TV to this mount.",0,Negative
"While it's a well made, sturdy mount that comes with plenty of mounting hardware, this mount suffers from three critical failings:1) Some of the material describing this mount says it has a few degrees of rotational adjustment -- it doesn't, unless you could loosening the screws, shifting it, and tightening them again.2) The first point is not *that* big deal, except the build in level is *utter rubbish*.  Don't trust it at all -- get a proper level and use it.  Otherwise your TV will be askew and there won't be anything you can do about it.3) There are no horizontal &#34;stops&#34; on the piece holding the TV, so you could theoretically have the whole thing setup and tightened up... and then slide the TV sideways off the mount.  Not what I expected, nor what I want.",0,Negative

"It's the 2nd Cheetah I purchased. Last one was for my 46inch and this time is for my 60 inch.One thing to note is the building quality on this one is much better than my last purchase. Could be just luck:) When the the arm sticks out, the front panel (holding the TV) is actually still levels up well! Not like my last one.The instruction is poor as many as figured but it still works OK.The screws (length) and spacers does not fit very well on my Samsung TV. I had to drill to make the hole bigger on the spacer and it was kinda risky because if I go too fast or make the hole too big, then it won't hold the screws well. Lucky enough I made it.After I completed installation I found the spacers provided from Samsung that is supposed to work well with this particular model of TV. So &#34;ops&#34;.Anyway, I really like this product and the price is right. The problem I had was most likely just for the TV (Samsung), since my last one works just fine with Sony with original screws and spacers from Cheetah.",0,Negative
Well built and sturdy.  My only complaint is the force needed to reposition the TV.  It's not a huge concern because I rarely move the TV but something to consider if you are going to be moving the TV on a daily basis.,2,Negative
"this was my 3rd wall mount from cheetah. its the first one that articulates with full motion dual arm. (the other 2 were normal wall mounts). This mount is very heavy and sturdy. the arms were hard to move but i loosened the bolts just a fraction and it made a huge difference! when the arms are contracted closest to the mount the bracket is fine. But when i have my 55"" sony LCD hanging on the mount with the arms extended and turned, the tv sagged 5 degrees to the side. it was crooked because the weight of it and the moment of the tv on the arms. i wouldnt recommend it for over a 47"" tv. I ended up taking the mount out and not using it. im disappointed! it was worth a try though",2,Negative
"This is a nice mount, but one of the screws thats essential to hold the TV to it won't go into place. Seems like the hole it goes in is on a little too much of an angle. Being that the boxes were discuarded and it was bolted to the wall by the time this problem prevented itself, I am just dealing with it.",0,Negative
"I did a lot of research before purchasing this product, my only reservation was the low price and some reviews complaining about missing pieces or cheap hardware. The unit is very heavy, of high quality, shipped quickly and no pieces were missing. I purchased this for use with a KDL60EX645, an application for which this is overkill (the TV only weights around 60 pounds)...but at this price it's a no-brainer. Don't pay more for another brand (once a TV is hung nobody can tell what brand it is anyway) or pay someone to install for you...it really is quite easy.The only complaint I have would be the stiffness of the joints out of the box, other than that it really is faultless.Things to know:- the mount is heavy and too awkward to get on the wall without a second pair of hands- highly recommend a drill with 3/8"" bit, 4 foot level and 1/2 "" socket and ratchet, this will make installation MUCH easier- out of the box the joints are very stiff, once you get this mounted I recommend taking a few minutes and working the articulations out and back to loosen them up, once a TV is hung on this it will be very difficult to move if you don't do this. After 4 months of use it still pulls out and turns very smoothly",2,Negative
"I ordered 2 of these mounts in September 2013.  I mounted the base, but couldn't afford the TV till now.  Sadly, one of the TV mounts were easily damaged and my painters through out the second set the TV hardware damaged.  Due to this, I ordered a 3rd mount to replace the bent model as I finally was having the TV delivered Thursday.I was shocked that even though I ordered the exact Amazon item, but they now switched to a super flimsy model that is twice as hard to assemble and has 50% less steel support.  Worse yet, the smaller hardware wouldn't fit the base I've already mounted and painted on the wall.On Monday I emailed Cheetah that they sent me the wrong mount.  After sending multiple pictures they responded:***Thank you for the images. This is mount has been redesigned. The one you did receive is the new version of the APDAM2B. It has the same specifications as the older model APDAM2B. If you have any questions or comments please feel free to contact our customer service center***Not only did they refuse to send the TV mount hardware by Thursday...they also haven't responded in two days for my request for a UPS prepaid box for the two mounts I now am returning.",0,Negative
"This is a good mount but as stated on the descroption the wall plate is only 27"" wide and very narrow so it can only mount to two studs with two screws per stud. I have a 50"" TV and it looks massive compared to the mount. I wouldn't be comfortable mounting a 65"" TV on this base fearing that any bump would rip the mount off the wall. This could be more of a problem if the arms are kept extended creating a large moment arm. This mount is very well constructed and would be perfect if the wall plate was just a little bigger.",2,Negative
"This would not hold our 65&#34; plasma TV.  When mounted, the mounting bracket bends due to the weight.  Also, the tilt is straight as much as possible and the TV still tilts towards the ground.  Unfortunately, because of the 30 day return police I cannot return this item.  It has taken us more than 30 days to get all the wiring done and the surround sound in to mount the TV.  Not a happy customer at all.  I really wasn't aware that their was only a 30 day return.  I will be less likely to order some things from Amazon going forward.",0,Negative
"When I wanted to get my parents' TV mounted, I got so discouraged by the prices at the big box stores. They were ridiculous, and installation was soooo overly expensive it should be illegal. When I found this, I was soooooo happy. The kit came with most of the things you need to install it. My fiance and dad put it up in no time. It is somewhat difficult to tilt and  maneuver, especially for older folks. Maybe WD40 would fix that problem? Great product for the money",4,Negative

"This is a sturdy, great product for the $64 I spent on it.  I had the snake oil salesman that sold me my TV try to sell me a wall mount for close to $300 that was complete garbage.  The set up it easy enough.  It comes with a level, though you should probably use your own level and a stud finder to properly mount it.My complaints:  The swivel joints are too tight and it requires substantial force to reposition the TV.  You can loosen them with a wrench to solve the problem.  The other problem is the steel is really hard and will hurt your teeth if you chew on it.  The solution to this problem is obviously to get aShock Doctor Adult Gel Max Strapless Mouthguardso that you can gnaw all day and not chip your enamel.",0,Negative
"The Good:-Fantastic Value for the Price-Premium HDMI Cable-After I mounted it. I did notice that it wobbled left and right. I saw that there were negative reviews on here because of the way it wobbles and none of them mentioned a way to fix it. But for those in the same situation; the wobbling stops when you tighten the two bolts that are on the two arms that connect to the plate that the TV hangs from. Makes it totally stable.-Solid manufactured mountThe Bad:-limited attachment screws for TV.

"This mount works great for my 50&#34; Panasonic Plasma (110lbs.). I mounted into brick over fireplace. Only reason it is not 5 stars is there is a little tilt in the set. Still works for me since I need the tilt to see it. If the TV attach points were not so far apart (26&#34;), I doubt it would have this problem. I did have to buy longer screws for the TV than were supplied with the mount, but again that was due to having a non VESA TV.",0,Negative
Nice quality product but a bit disappointed that it will not adjust down or back. You can only pull it out and adjust it from side to side.,2,Negative
"great mount! extremely sturdy and we're very pleased with our purchase. we were nervous about hanging our expensive tv, but no worries now.",3,Negative
"I originally mounted this using the back mount (with my own level, not the built in one, as that was off big time).  Then I looked at the mount standing back a bit and noticed while the back part looked level, the front did not when I pulled it out.  This is the part that the TV mounts on.  I ended up placing the level on the front part the next time I mounted and it that solved the problem.  Just make sure you use YOUR OWN LEVEL and USE IT ON THE FRONT, not the back, as they might not be equal.EDIT - After 2 years with this mount, I've found other issues.  I do not recommend this mount.1. The Arms do not have a knob to tighten them into place.  Why is this important?  My TV would always tip backwards any time I attempted to move it2.  The articulating feature is worthless.  It's HARD to move the TV back and forth... I feel as if I am going to crack my TV with the amount of pressure I have to put on it in order to move it.3.  The Arms are a bit too short.  I upgraded from a 46"" to a 55"" TV and had an issue with using the hole that I wanted to use to mount the TV just right.4.  The instructions are absolutely terrible. garbage.  worthless.DO  NOT  BUY  THIS  MOUNT",0,Negative
"Not sure why all the good reviews for this have been posted.  Yes the packaging and hardware was labeled and easy to identify and Amazon promptly got this out to us...  Aside from that the mount is very weak and can't even support the weight of our small 40&#34; Sony television.  The mount has some tilt abilities but when you go to tighten the tilt bracket you can't even do it with the TV installed as the bracket arm has a lever rod that isn't allowed to turn freely without hitting the back of the TV!... so you'll have to dismount the TV and remove the mounting brackets from the TV first before tightening the tilting arms... oh and forget about getting them tight because again the poorly designed lever rods stop at the worst angle possible leaving the rods located in the way of the TV back or the mount plate so when you move the rod out of the way the only direction it will turn is to loosen it!  Having said this upon returning the TV back onto the mount the TV sags toward the ground as the mount is just weak... granted the TV is only 41 pounds!  Yes I mounted 4 lag screws into wood studs @ 16&#34; on center so there is no doubt in my mind that the mount itself is to blame for the weakness of not being able to support a TV in the vertical position...  Also, this happens when the mount is fully closed/tight to the wall without spanning any distance open!The 2nd star rating was for the packaging and organized hardware...  Save your money for something stronger and more stable.  I wasn't able to install this product within the return window so I guess I've been &#34;cheetah'd&#34; out of my money and stuck with it until I can save some more $ for a QUALITY replacement... any suggestions on what to get that isn't as weak/poorly made as this one?Good luck to all...",0,Negative
"The mount is ""rated"" for well over 100 lbs, but it doesn't hold my 94-lb TV without tilting forward. It also tilts side-to-side if the TV isn't perfectly centered on the bracket. And before anyone asks, the mount was perfectly level (well, as perfectly as a bubble level - not the included cheap one - can tell) before hanging the TV on it (I checked level by rotating the level 180 degrees until the bubble stayed in the same spot in each orientation), and the wall is not bowing perceptibly from the weight. The back plate is securely screwed to the wall studs at all four locations and remains level/vertical the entire time.When I remove the TV, the bracket returns to level. The problem is that the sheet metal lip onto which the TV hooks hang bends forward once the TV is hung, and there is no means provided for leveling.Also, the four bolts that adjust side-to-side level after the mount is attached to the wall utilize plastic washers (must be decorative; whoever heard of plastic washers for weight-bearing connections?) that deform terribly once you tighten the adjusting bolts.The bracket also has no means to prevent the TV from sliding sideways off the mount; the rail onto which the hooks hang have no stoppers, screws, or any means of securing sideways motion on the bracket. Who would want to entrust their expensive equipment to such a design?I'm terribly disappointed in the unit, and I'm dismayed that I'll have to pay shipping and ""restocking"" fees for a mount that is not capable of its advertised functions.",0,Negative
I wrote a big long winded review of this and submitted this under the non adjustable mount review (VideoSecu brand).  Anyway the reason I don't give this one 5 stars is because the bushings have loose tolerances but the manufacturer has left room for dialing in adjustment after the mount has been attached to the wall,0,Negative
"Note to everyone buying this equipment:This is a very low quality mount.  It does the job, and holds a heavy TV - but it sags, and the back plate is bending.This mount also says it will work with 16&#34; stud spacing, but in reality you should not use it for that.  I mounted a 55&#34; Sony LED on this thing with the stud mounting at 16&#34; spacing; and the back plate is now heavily bent between the bolting locations.  Does not exactly inspire me with confidence.Lastly, the arms are very stiff, and with a heavy TV hanging on it you basically have to be He-Man to move it around.Would not purchase again.",2,Negative
"This bracket is dangerous. Its weak and bends with any TV greater than 50lbs. Lots of reviews indicate there has been some kind of change in this product and it's not the same quality as it once was. I would not recommend it to anyone. There is no way the rear support bracket can bridge a 24&#34; studded wall and support a heavy TV, just think about the weight in the middle of that weak rear support bracket. DONT BUY",0,Negative
"I bought a purchased a Vizio 39&#34; LED tv from Amazon during the holidays, and needed a wall mount for my office. I had a problem in that my wall had 24&#34; stud spacing in the wall, and most mounts need 16&#34;. This mount will work for 24&#34; spacing. This mount was ordered from SPN Performance, and it does not look like the current picture. The one pictured is very &#34;thin&#34; and light looking. The one I got was a solid plate to mount to the wall.  The instructions were clear enough to me (this whole process of hanging a tv on the wall isn't that hard) and came with a plethora of hardware options, which seemed to handle my  &#60; 40lb, 39&#34; tv just fine. I used my own level, as I didn't trust the built in one, nor the 6&#34; one included. I have not tried the HDMI cable yet. It seems to move and articulate well, not great, but sufficient for my use. No drooping or sagging when the TV is pulled all the way out from the wall.",2,Negative
Not good for any TV at 90 LBS. Way too flimsy. Could not even get the TV to stay vertical.was bouncing lightly when ceiling fan was on. It maybe good for 50 LBS TV (not for 90 LBS).Forget 165 LBS there is no way.,0,Negative
"I ordered this partially because of the rating.  It said it would hold a lot of weight.  While the bracket won't fall off the wall, the 3ft piece the TV hangs on is CRAPPPPPP!!!!!!!!.  The TV is a Samsung LCD about 5 years old.  It weighs about 60lbs.  The piece I am referring to is bending enough that the TV is leaning forward.  The piece is actually bowed.  This is the 5th TV I have hung.  All the rest are on Sanus.  I thought I would try a Cheetah.  Now I have to buy a Sanus to replace the Cheetah.  I worried if my kids sit directly underneath.  I am thinking most of the reviews on this product were written by Cheetah.  Please ignore them and listen to me.  DON'T BUY THIS.",0,Negative
"First, I've been remodeling homes for about 40 years so I have a good idea how to build things. Second, I've installed several TV mounts so I'm familiar with how they work. On this particular job where we used this mount I immediately noticed that the mount didn't come close to matching the picture/illustration located on the Amazon website. I can't say if this is a picture that Amazon or Cheetah posted, but I'd bet Cheetah posted/supplied the pictures to Amazon. Anyway, the first 90% of the installation is nearly the same for all mounts and was no different for this. There was no drywall on the wall, actually there was no wall at all, so I had complete control over how this was attached to the studs so I was able to completely customize the stud location for ease of mounting. It was after it was mounted that the problem started.The industry standard for mounting TV's to TV brackets all follow an industry standard called VESA for the spacing of the mounting screws on the back of your TV. Lets say VESA 100 means that the mounting screws are located in a square pattern that has 4 screws, one in each corner of that square pattern, that are 100 millimeters apart. This would be for a small, 19"" TV. VESA 200 would be for mounting a larger TV with screws located in a square pattern 200 millimeters apart and so on. When the VESA pattern is an odd size (I'm looking at you Panasonic) you can still mount the TV but it's done slightly differently. Most wall mounts up to VESA 400X600 allow you to mount the TV directly to the mount with the 4 screws. When the mounts become larger than that (in this case the Panasonic 65st60 65""plasma TV we were trying to mount has mounting holes 27.5"" , or nearly 800MM,apart) then you don't mount the TV directly to the mount. What you do is you mount 2 large hooks (ALMOST all of these parts are located in the package) to the back of the TV and then hang the TV on the mount. Now if the mount were made of thick (1/8"" at least) steel and was well supported by the mount along the whole length of where the TV is hung, the mount would probably work. Unfortunately, it's not. For TV's that have mounting holes 27.5"" apart like mine (28"" is the limit with this model BTW) you will hang it on the very end of the hangars. The hangers that are used are very thin, U shaped pieces of steel that you have to bolt together. The pictures included on this site are not like the mount I got.  After placing the 80 pound TV on the hanger and then slowly letting go, the TV tilted forward about 20 degrees and I immediately thought it was going to crash to the floor. We removed the set and immediately came to the conclusion that this particular TV was never going to be mounted on this mount. Unfortunately by this time I had painted the mount and drilled two holes in it to pull wires through so I'm stuck with it, but hopefully you won't be.There are other problems too. Like I said, the instructions show you bolting various parts together and TELL you to bolt them together but they don't give you any nuts. Lots of bolts and star washers and plastic anchors for mounting into brick, but not a nut in sight. As a matter of fact the instructions are rather vague and poorly written. I realize they use a more or less generic set of instructions for each mount because they can't print so many different ones up for each size, but they should. I have a couple of containers of metric nuts and bolts that I've accumulated over the years. If you don't I guarantee you'll be making a trip to the hardware store. Also, when you go to that hardware store pick up an inexpensive 2' level and throw away the one that comes with this mount. It serves no real purpose.I can't say how well this would work for other models of TV's, I'm guessing that if the mounting holes are 28"" apart like these were, the problem would persist. If the mounting holes were closer together, say only 14"" apart, the mount may work. I purchased some steel brackets from Home Depot and made my own, which is what I should have done to begin with. It doesn't extend or turn from side to side, but you can still adjust the tilt and the client is much happier with what they consider a much safer mounting solution.",2,Negative
"This item comes prettily packaged, and has a few unexpected extras (a torpedo level, a wide variety of mounting hardware). That said, there are two really bad flaws with this product, such that I probably won't be purchasing another one.The first flaw -- the base mounting plate is less than 32&#34; wide. This means that you'll only be able to mount it to two studs. Corollary to this, the screws intended for this are a lot shorter than I'm comfortable with. If you've got thick plaster or moisture-proof drywall, you may only get about one or two inches of threads into the studs. Even more terrifying, they include drywall toggles, which I most assuredly would not trust to support the 100+ pound weight of a plasma TV.The second flaw -- the part of the mount the TV hooks onto is poorly engineered. Again, it's not very wide -- meaning you'll only have an inch on either side of the plate for the TV to slide. There are the typical Allen safety screws on the bottom, but there's no lip for them to grab. The outcome is this -- a sharp lateral knock on the side of the TV mounted to this mount will knock it off the mount. I spent three bucks at the hardware store for longer screws to mount to the studs and for some screws in the top of the TV mount to keep the TV from sliding off. If they'd included these items in the box, I'd be giving this a 5-star review.",2,Negative
"I ordered one of these last year and it looked exactly like the photo. It was a very sturdy mount, so when I needed another I decided to order a second because I liked the first so well. Let's just say that they've really changed the design. No longer do you get a sturdy high quality mount for your TV. I could tell something was wrong before I even opened the box because the new one weighs about a quarter what the old one did. When I opened the box I found pieces of flimsy pieces of metal that is held together by not much more than a bunch of nuts and bolts. Very disappointing.",2,Negative
"I paid a LOT of money for a 65 inch plasma TV, and I decided I wanted it on the wall,  I wanted a mount that moved, but couldn't see spending a few hundred dollars on one.  I was a LITTLE concerned about this, but I read many, many reviews, and I ordered it.  I asked my installer to be brutally honest and tell me if it wasn't as good as the ones he sold--he couldn't do it!  He was very impressed and told me my expensive TV is not going anywhere!I think it's important to have a professional (or at least someone very skilled with DIY things) install this.  I think many of the issues people have complained about were due to improper installation.My guy DID drill some extra holes and stuck some screws in them to hold the unit more upright; an amateur might not have known how to do that.My TV looks incredible with the cables in the walls and turned towards my lounging spot!  This was a fantastic purchase!",4,Negative

Well, let me put that dog to bed first...TOOLS NEEDED THAT WILL MAKE THIS AN EASY JOB:Drill with 3/8&#34; bit for wood/drywall installationHammer Drill (for concrete/brick wall installation only).  Do not attempt without a hammer/impact drill3/8&#34; Masonry bit (for concrete/brick wall installation only).  Expect to pay $7-$12 for this.At least TWO - 3/8 x 2.25 SLEEVE ANCHORS (read review to see why you need this).  About $3 eaA good socket wrench set that will handle METRIC sizes (everything in box is METRIC)Set of METRIC allen wrenchesVarious other small tools that any do-it-yourself-er should have &#8211; hammer, Phillips screwdriver, tape measure, etc.Now for my review....PROS:  Price!  Price!  Price!  And once it's finally installed it looks really sharp!  It also comes with TWO different levels which is nice.CONS:  Time, time, time.  And MISSING HARDWARE (explained below).  And be prepared to make a run to the hardware store to spend an extra $10 or $15 bucks (or in my case quite a bit more...more on that later as well).ASSEMBLY:  You will spend at least 1-2 hrs assembling this tv mount out of the box.  The price is CHEAP because it's only 20% assembled when it arrives.  It is, however, very sturdy and well-built.INSTRUCTIONS:  The instructions are written in plain, understandable English.  But I found the PICTURES to be life-saving as I got confused reading the instructions.  So just stick with the pictures and you will be fine.  Although there is a section about mounting to a BRICK/CONCRETE wall which is very good so make sure to read that if that is your plan (as was the case with my installation).HARDWARE:  You get lots, and I mean LOTS, of extra hardware - which is always nice.  This is truly a universal tv mount and I would be surprised if this thing couldn't fit ANY flat screen tv on the market.  BUT!!!  And this is an important BUT...  The most important hardware you need are the LAG SCREWS/PLASTIC ANCHORS that will screw into your wall and hold the mount...which holds your very expensive, brand new, 60 inch LED tv (in my case)...  So these LAG SCREWS are somewhat important (ha).  That being said...the instructions (and the nice pictures) state that you will secure the tv mount to your wall with SIX (6) lag screws.  But lo and behold...this tv mount ONLY COMES WITH FOUR (4) LAG SCREWS and FOUR (4) PLASTIC WALL ANCHORS!!!  ARRRGHHH!!HOW MANY TRIPS WILL I MAKE TO THE HARDWARE STORE?  I made three trips.  But if you read this you should only make ONE trip!AWESOME!  TELL ME HOW:  Lots of reviewers have stated that they don&#8217;t trust the lag screws which are included and therefore run off to the hardware store to buy their own.  I ended up using the FOUR lag screws and plastic anchors included in the box and bought TWO 3/8 x 2.25 sleeve anchors so that I would have a total of SIX (6) screws and anchors holding everything on my brick wall.  So this part is completely up to you.  If you are making a trip to the store anyway you might as well go ahead and buy SIX sleeve anchors instead of two&#8230;.  I found the 4 lag screws/plastic anchors included in the box to work just fine.  But I just could not live with the instructions saying I should have six and only using four (because that&#8217;s all that was included)&#8230; so off to the store I went!WHY SLEEVE ANCHORS?  I did some YouTubing and most people that know a hell of a lot more than I do when it comes to hanging heavy things on brick walls suggested sleeve anchors&#8230;so that&#8217;s what I bought.  And I have to say they are right.  Sleeve anchors are pretty much idiot-proof and will hold a crap-load of weight.WHY USE A 3/8 SCREW OR ANCHOR WHEN I KNOW I CAN GO BIGGER??!  I WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS DAMN THING IS IN THERE GOOD AND TIGHT!!  Do not&#8230; I repeat, DO NOT try to be a hero and buy anything larger than a 3/8 anchor or screw with this tv mount because it WILL NOT WORK!!  That is because all of the holes in the mount will only support a 3/8 screw or anchor.4 out of 5 stars because of those two damn missing lag screws.  If not for that I would give it 5 stars.",2,Negative
"Others have written a bunch and I'm neither a techie nor a writer. First, the price was much more reasonable than others I've seen elsewhere (including the Best Buy newspaper insert this weekend).

I do a lot of DIY stuff so am familiar with studs, spacing, lag bolts, etc. One review (I think -- since I read it a few months ago before buying this) mentioned that they weren't real comfortable hanging their TV from the 'bar'. I compare this method to a woodworking/cabinet making 'French cleat'. If built correctly -- and they're hard to screw up -- a French cleat on a wall will hold most anything. The only thing that I could even possibly criticize is the 'handles/dumbbells' that have to be loosened or tightened when adjusting the angle. I was able to adjust the tilt after I hung it but it was with some trouble because the handles are tight against the bracket. I've written more than I intended to -- simply because I think this is an extraordinarily well-made, easily installed, (dare I say it?) slightly under-priced mount.",0,Negative
Not the exact mount listed but it worked.  Unfortunately the one we got did not extend out as far from the wall as the listing stated.,2,Negative
I'm not sure what the point of the built in level was.  It was just wrong.  Luckily they provided an additional level.  I was able to install it with no problems.  Instructions were adequate.  I did'nt need to buy any additional Hardware.  Currently holding up my 5yr old 40&#34; LCD TV.  Probably 65lbs.,0,Negative
"Immediately there was an issue.  The Desc in Amazon is 32""to 65"" yet the box says 32"" to 55"".  I look more closely and search the web.  The Cheetah website says the APDAM2B is the bigger one but the box I have says the model is APDAM2B with APDAM3B desc.  A double whammy of WTF!! I am so confused and disappointed at the same time.  I have not yet pulled it out of the box and nothing is what it seems.  The weight of the unit is different from different websites.  Stud spacing claims up to 24"" on the Amazon web but 26"" on the box.",1,Negative
It is does not tilt in the top to bottom plane and was not very useful as I was trying to install it in my bedroom and was trying to adjust the TV face downwards toward the bed. It has sideways tilt... but that is not very useful for a TV.,2,Negative
the mount is very hard to installsince you cant hang anything you need two people and you need to mount the tv while the mount is already on the wallits good that its mostly for small tvs and monitorsthe build seems ok but not too great some screws are really short and crappy and there is a tilt to the tv when you hang itthe price is what makes it,4,Negative
"I used this to hang my 32"" (18 lb) HDTV in my bedroom. Item is sturdy. I would give it 5 stars, but I had to go to Home Depot to buy the screws I needed to attach the TV to the wall mount since the screws that came with it were too small.another thing is that after moving the TV back and forth and tilting it a few times the screw that tightens the tilting plate came a bit loose making the TV turn about 15 degrees clockwise. I had to take the TV down and tighten the nut to prevent it from coming off and dropping the TV.Other than that, the mount works awesomely.",0,Negative
"I have an led monitor on this arm that doesn't weigh much. If I don't move the arm just so, the whole monitor tilts to the left. Infuriating! With effort I can get the whole thing level again (I actually keep a small level near the monitor now). However, it makes me not want to move the monitor. Mostly I just don't move it anymore except by accident.BTW I mounted this level.Still, I gave it 4 stars because it is cheap and works well enough. Also, many people probably don't need/want to move their monitor once it is in place.",2,Negative

I used this mount to mount a DELL all-in-one computer to the wall in our kitchen.  This is a very nice mount and I have no fear that it can not hold my DELL computer.PRO:- the arm articulates... meaning you can swing it in and out for easier viewing.- very sturdy mountCON:- I had to use different screws to mount this to the wall.  The screws that come with this mount are not very good,2,Negative
ordered mount because it said it was for what i needed.  its not.  as usuall!  not made for tvs sold in america!its made for midget tvs.  does not fit one monitor or tv i can find and have checked.  cost more to ship back than worth..cheeta mounts  is short for cheat you!,4,Negative
I've been using this bracket for almost a year now. After about 3-4 months of usage I started noticing that the joints were developing 'play' (loose joints). The problem with play in the joints is that the slightest of the play will make the LCD set tilted. Which is very annoying.,0,Negative
"First - no issues at all with seller.  Fast shipping, and package in good condition.  Next - no issues with basic installation. Used a stud-finder to find the stud (wasn't where I hoped - but not a product issue), and bolted it to the wall.  The 2 problems came at this point.  You either have to hold the TV in the air while bolting the back portion into the stud, or while bolting the TV to the bracket. There should be a connecting/disconnecting point between the 2.  However, got past that with some help (since the TV has to be under 30 lbs anyhow).  Here came the next problem - my TV weighs ~20 lbs. The final ""swivel"", regardless of how much I tighten it - slips.  I've tried at least 15-20 times.  One side, and the the other (with the enclosed L wrench). After a few tries, I thought I would tighten/tilt/tighten/tilt, etc.  It seemed to hold - until the next morning when the TV was facing the floor.  I then got an extender to give the L wrench a little more torque.  Tried to tighten - nope.  Tried the tighten/tilt/tighten/tilt all over again and it worked... until the next morning when the TV was facing the floor again.  It's coming down now.",0,Negative
still sitting in box. I have no opinion.,0,Negative
I am a pretty handy person and took the chance at buying this figuring I would be able to handle any problems I encountered.  I had no problems at all.  The tv stays level when away from the wall.  I have it set up at approximately a 45 degree angle from the wall and at a slight angle facing downwards.  We use it in our bedroom with a 32&#34; so we can watch while we are going to bed.,3,Negative
"It's really well built, fast shipping. I had no problems installing this and would buy one more when i will need wall mount that articulates.",4,Negative
"I was excited to get this thing mounted, but frustrated to find that the welds are crooked.  I can set the television perfectly level, and then rotate the unit away from the wall (to the left or right) so that viewing from an adjacent room is possible, only to find that the TV is now 10-15 degrees out of level.....push it back against the wall and it's level again.  Really frustrating.",2,Negative
"I needed a mount for a corner in my family room above a fireplace for my 55 inch LCD.  This mount works exactly as I expected and if you are on the fence like I was then no need to worry (minus the other comments I have below).If your goal is to set this in one position, then this mount is for you.  If your plan is to have it flat against the wall one day and then swing it out to position viewing for another part of the room tomorrow, then this mount may not be for you.  The reason is due to physics in that the weight put on the mount when swung will change how level the mount is so you have to adjust the tv to make it level.  There are four screws on the back to allow this leveling but I don't view this is designed to be a change it every day thing.  If your TV is big it is very difficult to go back and forth.  You end up pulling the TV out a little to get back there level it then move where you want and you are out of level.The mount is very solid.  I put a 55 inch TV on it that was almost 50lbs.The directions were good, not sure what the complaint was there.  It is a TV mount not assembling a circuit board.  So unless you have never picked up a cordless drill before you will have no issues with this minus the weight.Besides the four stuf lag screws, I put one SnapToggle BB Toggler (Toggler 24014 Bb 1/4-20 100/Pack Snaptoggle Toggle Bolt) on the top middle of the mount.  I don't really think that is neceassary but it certainly made it even more snug.There appeared to be every screw and washer under the sun included so maybe they added these of late.  It came with screws that would fit my Vizo 47 and the Vizio 55.  However, I chose to get my own set of screws at a hardware store because they used a socket head instead of a phillips since I was scared of stripping.  I did buy larger lag screws also just because the reviews scared me into it and I was going into a 2x6 so adding even more grip.When you install mark your pilot holes, remove the mount then drill.  I made the mistake of drilling the top two then putting in the lag screws and then having to drill the bottom pilots while the mount was up was difficult on my cordless drill.  Getting the slots to line up where the center of my OC 16"" studs were was a little tricky.  I needed the slots on the mount to be just a little wider but in the end I got it.  The weight of the unit holding it up while doing all of this is a pain but the weight is what makes the mount sturdy.Other reviewers talk about taking the mount apart to grease it and make it easier to move.  It is true that the mount is stiff and harder to move.  But unless you plan on positioning the mount all the time (which see above is not encouraged due to hard to level) you basically use some elbow grease to move it into position and then you know it is where it is going to be solid.",0,Negative
"For a cheap articulating wall mount unit, it does what it is supposed to do, but you do get what you pay (not much) for. It is a very heavy unit, but the hinge is not well made, and after hanging on my wall for a few months, it takes bear strength to get it to pull away from the wall as the hinges have started to sag. I would not buy this again, but if you don't want to spend much you could do worse.",0,Negative
"I mounted this to the wall by myself.  It was HEAVY.  I think it was just as heavy as my 37"" TV.  The construction of the frame makes you feel that this thing isn't going anywhere!  Only problem was when I wanted to extend the arm. Maybe it needed some oil, or maybe bolts were too tight, but it took some effort to extend the arm out! I was nervous pulling the tv out because I really had to tug at it to extend it.  other than that, stand will definately hold your tv.  No worries their!",2,Negative
Most articulation of any mount I've ever installed.  Design and materials seem to be top notch.  Installed in a room with small children and have no concern of the TV falling on them.  Have not tested as &#34;monkey bars&#34; yet.,0,Negative
"I was ""forced"" to buy this mount because I had 24"" studs in the wall where the TV was to be mounted, and this was one of the few or only articulating mounts I could find which would fit that out of the box.  While it kept the TV from falling, the arm didn't work that well, to the point that it was unusable, and it didn't collapse snuggly into the bracket.  I connected the included HDMI cable to a new BluRay player and had months of poor performance, which I attributed to the BluRay, only to find out the other day, that it was actually a bad cable!  I also took the TV down to do some maintainence on the wall recently, and when I did, I found that the weight of the TV had bent one of the brackets and I had to buy a whole new mount!  When I called VideoSecu to report the broken item and HDMI cable, they told me that they only warranted their products for 90 days from date of purchase, so now I am left with a worthless piece of junk.  I would not recommend this product to any one.  I would love to give this product two stars, because it did mount the TV to the wall and keep it from falling, but between the bad arm, the failing TV bracket, the broken HDMI cable, and the lousy manufacturer support, I can't justify giving this product anything above the lowest score possible.",1,Negative
"This unit is very sturdy and secure. It currently holds my 55&#34; TV. The only thing I do not particularly like is repositioning this thing. I'm not sure if it needs some WD-40, but it is very tight to adjust.",4,Negative
i used to have a wall mount that just tilted and was looking to upgrade to full motion. This mount was a reasonable price and does exactly that. it extends so far away from the wall i can easily walk behind my tv and connect cables or whatever else i need to do. It is a little hard to move because of the way the arm is but no the less it moves wherever you want it to. I have a 40 in tv and i can turn it just about completely sideways to view it.,2,Negative
"I bought this one after trying a crap Cheetah mount that I returned. There is no comparison in the quality between this and the Cheetah. The Cheetah was not articulated, but you can notice the difference in the material used. This is very solid.The only complain is a missing screw to attach the tv to the mount. I had to use a longer one with a spacer for now. I'll contact manufacturer to send me one. If wasn't for this I would give it 5 stars.",0,Negative
"The wall I mounted this on only had one stud this thing could attach to. I have 2' spacing and this could not reach more than one. I chose to use the three center holes over the stud, then I used 6 120lbs drywall anchors in the rest. I pulled hard on it with just the three center bolts in the stud and it seemed stout but I didnt want to risk a 1500.00 TV falling.Because of this I had to slide the TV all the way to the right side of its mount and it is still not centered on the wall, THAT DRIVES ME MAD! It is close but not perfect so I will be bothered by it for a very long time. Also with all the weight on one side of the mount all the slop from the multiple axis make the TV droop a little to that side. I had to keep adjusting it over and over to get it level.",2,Negative
"I just received this today,  I wanted something with double stud mount,  the reason is because this tv will mostly be used at nearly 90 degrees from the wall.  Therefore I am more worried about the downforce twisting the single wall stud mount.  I've seen it on heavier tv's  it can really tweak the stud, twisting it.It does not have the nice shiny black finish of some of the higher end mounts.  There is no built in cable management.  So...  Its an uglier mount.  Keep that in mind depending on the location you mount it at.  The finish is more of a powder coating.Also pay attention to how far it hangs off the wall in the ""Flush"" position, this one is nearly 5 inches.  There are other more flush sitting mounts.  Not a negative, just something to be aware of when purchasing.All that being said, I'm sure it will do the trick.  Just not as refined as other mounts.",2,Negative
"It took a little while to adjust and install, but it holds our 55 inch tv up without any issues. Great value.",4,Negative
"First off, my apologies to anyone who has purchased a different TV mount. You are seriously missing out. This stand does it all.It's tough as nails (most people could hang from it without the extra weight of a TV on it), it can lay flat, extend out in seriously any direction, and it's much cheaper than other less capable options.You can pay less, but you will get a lot less. You can even pay more, but I bet you'd still end up with something worse.",0,Negative
"To the people who have given reviews that this is complicated and hard to mount. I'm sorry but you must not know the difference between a hammer and screwdriver. I mounted a 40 inch Samsung which is 5 years old, so its its about 50 pounds.  The mounting is pretty out of the box easy. I do find fault with a couple things. The hardware is made in China and as with most screws and nuts made there the quality control is absent. I had miss stamped screws and some with no threads. I have access to good hardware so it was no problem. I can see however where it would be a problem to someone who has to make a trip to the hardware store because the screws supplied don't fit or are junk.  Also, In the directions it tells you to find your studs which are usually 16 inches on center. DUH! Well that's fine, why did they slot holes every 3.5 inches on center? Its hard to arrive at 16 this way. They should be 4"" on center. You can make it work by angling the screws a little. For being constructed in China it is actually very solid. The range of motion is very good. The unit movement is stiff so if you intend on moving it a lot you may want to spray some lube on the joints.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants to mount a Large TV. I would have given it 5 instead of 4 stars if not for the problems I mentioned.",2,Negative
"The mont works fine, and it wasn't too difficult for the installation. Only thing I didn't like was the set of screws provided for connecting with the TV; the screw was too short, and I could put in any washer between the screw and the TV itself.",0,Negative
"But may look for something that has a bigger mounting plate.Only one side of the small mounting plate lined up with the screw holes on my 26"" Westinghouse.Also the knob on the back for adjusting up & down isnt right.Ill fiddle with it,since it will be in my motorhome & not really used that much,only because I really hate returning things.",0,Negative
"Throw away the lag bolts and replace them with hardened steel bolts. I twisted the heads off of one just tightening it to the wall stud. Otherwise, it works just fine.",0,Negative
"Some users have stated it can work with 40"" screens. Not for Samsung 40 LED TV.VideoSecu advertises an upgrade extensions kits to work with larger screens - however on their website, they no longer carry / sell this kit.So this mount does not work for my larger TV, only my smaller TV.",2,Negative
"The product is good enough for my 42 inch LG. Just a few minor complaints. All the hardware are there except for the lag screws. Also, the square tube frame had debris inside resulted from the punched holes. Took me a while to get them out to get rid of the rattling sound when you shake the frame. Otherwise, the product is good.",2,Negative
"*UPDATE 11-10-11* Apparently the design and sale of this mount has changed since my original review. It's now easier to install, and comes with an HDMI cable and level. Otherwise, most of my review still stands.I was planning to make my own TV mount because all the affordable ones were so cheaply made. That was until I stumbled on this one for $25.Wow, was I surprised when it arrived! Very nicely double-boxed and packaged extremely well. Then the construction is quality all the way, right down to the chrome-plated nuts, screws and bushings. This mount was manufactured and boxed as if it were a high-dollar item.It only took about 15 minutes to have my 37"" LG firmly hanging on the wall. Oh, and I did it all by myself.I can't comment on the mount-to-TV screws because my LG already provided them. And I did use my own 5/16"" flat washers on 2 of the lag screws since none were included, but that's just my preference.I highly recommend this mount, I would have been happy to pay double for such quality.Now, as usual, many of the reviews here are misleading:*Dismiss all reviews that talk about adjacent studs, or difficulties getting screws to grab at an angle. This thing BOLTS TO A SINGLE WALL STUD VERY EASILY! Just like what's shown on the instruction sheet, you simply screw 3 of the lag screws down the center of the mount. That's all that's needed, the other holes are just a bonus for more complicated setups. DO NOT PUT 6 OR 7 LAGS INTO A STUD! You will probably shred or weaken it. Crash goes your TV while ripping a chunk of 2x4 through your drywall.*Dismiss the reviews that mention short lag screws. They are 2"", that's a depth of almost 1 1/2"" into the stud after going through 1/2"" drywall and the mount. If you drilled roughly 3/16"" to 1/4"" diameter pilot holes and didn't over-tighten your lags, it should be fine. I've mounted mine twice now, using the same (provided) lags.*I have no idea where this review came from that complains about an adjustment knob getting in the way. My mount doesn't have any kind of knob on it whatsoever, perhaps they are commenting on a different model. There's a tilt adjustment, but it uses a wrench and doesn't protrude anywhere. The ONLY BAD PART I'VE FOUND is that cheap stamped sheet-metal wrench to tighten the tilt mechanism. No problem, I just used my own 13mm wrench instead.*Yes, the mount can be somewhat stiff. Like another reviewer stated, just lubricate it. I used a few drops of 3-In-1 Oil in the joints.*And bad reviews from people who didn't research or check to see if their TV or monitor is VESA compliant. That also includes the ones who didn't check to see if the mounting plate will block off their inputs. The plate is about 8 1/2"" square, it shouldn't be that hard to see if you'll have a conflict. Besides, in the description it says, ""Please make sure what mount your TV needs before you place order. If you are not sure, please send us a message. We will check for you."" So they are giving a nice product bad reviews because they simply didn't read the description.*Then all the complaints of trying to hold the TV to the mount while installing the screws. If you look at the pictures on Amazon you'll see the center screw hole is a ""keyhole"".1. Hold the mount to the wall and mark the 3 hole locations on the wall. On the center keyhole you want to only mark the narrow slot at the top.2. Drill (3) 3/16"" holes.3. Install center screw into the stud, but leave a small gap between the head and the drywall, you can even use the mount to test whether the slot in the ""keyhole"" passes behind the head.4. Lay your TV face-down on a safe place like a mattress or a table with a comforter over it. Place the mount over the back of the TV and install screws.5. Position the mount so the wall mounting plate is reasonably close to the TV and as close to center as possible, and simply hang it on the wall to the center lag screw through the keyhole. That should help with the weight while you screw the top lag in, then the bottom. Don't tighten anything completely until all 3 screws are in, then make sure it's level or plumb.That's it. This is an inexpensive, very well built product that solves a simple problem. I'll be ordering more for my PC monitors and future customers ASAP.",0,Negative
So many options for mounting TVs.  No problem holding up my 32&#34; older LCD (kind of heavy).  This cheap wall mount exceeded my expectations and the HDMI included works great!  I can't believe Best Buy or other stores get away with ripping people off on wall mounts... this is all you need!!,4,Negative

"Was worried this wouldn't hold my 32&#34; LCD TV in my bedroom, but it did, and there are no signs of it breaking anytime soon.  Only thing is it covers my one HDMI port and half of the other one (I have it squeezed in, barely).  But you can't make a universal wall mount without that happening occasionally.  If you're really worried about it covering up one of your ports, just make sure you have a way to cut metal when you get it just in case.",2,Negative

"Pros: Heavy duty, doesn't feel cheap.Cons: Plastic covers for the wall screws were broken.

Steel was heavy enoungh.  Plenty of screw choices included for about any TV brand made.  Included tool functioned.  Instructions were clear enough and large enough to read.The only complaint is that the wall mounting bracket isn't very attractive and no cover is included.

"All that had to be done was put a couple drops of router bit oil on each joint, line it up on the wall what height you need it and drill. In my case a concrete wall so I just used Tapcons with the washers. A no brainer really and it's really sturdy. The only problem I had was the back plate was in the way of an HDMI plug on a 27 in Samsung monitor so all I had to do was cut out a small chunk and file it smooth.As far as that one negative review someone complaining that they had theirs professionally installed and their tv fell off the wall and was ruined and blamed the mount doesn't know what they are talking about. That so called pro was just a hack and didn't hit a stud dead center or just mounted it on drywall only. No wonder it fell off DOH! Next time find a real pro that knows what they are doing.Also for the price you cannot beat this at all and all the adjusments work just fine and the full extension. The little torpedo level is useless though and not accurate. You can check by turning it around on the same surface and it should be the same but it's not. So use a real level. That one is going to the trash.(on edit) If you have trouble finding a stud normally they are 16 inches on center. You don't need one of those stud sensors at all. The only thing you need to do it tap back and forth on the wall with your knuckle and listen for the dead sound until you find what you think is the center of one. Then drive a small finish nail back and forth to find the center of 1 1/2 inches and mark that then a straight line down from there. Being in construction for 30 years never once had i need to use a stud sensor installing cabinets or whatever else.",0,Negative
"We just bought a VIZIO 32 inch flat screen TV from amazon n needed a wall mount. Walmart was WAY more money . This articulating wall mount pulls out  several inches and swivels. My problem is really with the TV.  If you place the flat screen too high (which is where I like it), you may not have enough length in the cords to place these cords against the wall to cancel. We bought a plastic long cover that just covers all 4 cords together n it hangs..",1,Negative
"Mounted two of these units and LCD TV's on the walls of my girl's rooms.  Piece of cake.  Very good construction and simple to mount with 2 bolts.1 Drawback is that the bolts do interfere with the swing arm going in, but after getting them tightened down all is well.

"The description states:  ""If your LCD Monitor or TV has 4 or *6* holes on the back of the screen, and they are either 50 x 50 mm (2"" x 2""), 75 x 75 mm (3"" X 3"") or 100x100 mm (4"" x 4""), 200x100mm (8"" x 4 ""), or 200x200 (8"" x 8"") apart from each other horizontally or vertically, *this bracket will fit*.""I have a 32"" ViewSonic LCD weighing approximately 33 pounds (well within the stated 66lb weight limit of the bracket) with 6 mounting holes that line up on 8""x8"" spacing.  The bracket for this mount only accommodates 4 of those mounting holes.  The result?  Once you've put holes in your wall and gone to the trouble of attaching the bracket, you'll find that because it doesn't attach at the TV's center of mass (e.g. the arm doesn't attach where the two center holes of the six are because the bracket is offset to one side of the television), the mount plate (and attached television) twists at the single bolt used for pivoting the screen up or down.The end result is your screen is twisted roughly 20 degrees off horizontal.  No amount of tightening the pivot adjustment bolt helps.Two holes in the wall and a heavy bracket that probably costs more to send back than it cost to buy in the first place.I can only conclude someone was being overly optimistic in the described compatibility, never actually TRIED the mount with a reasonable sized television that uses 6 mounting holes, or the bracket is another example of cheap imported junk and simply isn't capable of doing what is claimed.Maybe it works fine for 4 hole mounting, but if you have 6 on the back of your set, find something else.  Despite the compatibility claims, it won't work.I decided to give it two stars because at least the bracket didn't rip out of the wall, drop the television, or spontaneously self-destruct, despite being totally useless for the stated compatible application (six holes).",2,Negative
"Product arrived with accessories to spare.  Every screw/washer you could think of has been included.The arm was a bit tough to get moving (stiff, as it were), but I'd rather it be tough than too lose, as then it might move when you wouldn't want it to.It feels of good build quality, and went together easy enough.My only problems were that the lag bolts had a hex head, and unfortunately I did not have a hex driver bit, so instead of using the shoddy included wrench on the bolts, I used my own wrench, but the tight quarters made the process painful.  Also, the plate is affixed to the arm using two bolts, which I thought was a little odd.  It sits in a groove, but needs to be tightened down to keep it secure.This was very easy to level.  There was a little knob behind the plate that when loosened, allowed the tilt/swivel action on the tv at the plate, and using the included level, was very easy to get straight.The HDMI cable was a bonus, even though I didn't need one.All in all, I used six screws to attach the tv to the plate, using a washer on each of the edge screws because the holes were a little larger.  I then used 3 of the bolts (top/middle/bottom) to attach the arm to the wall into a stud.  I hung a 28"" with VESA 200x100 which weighed 32 lbs.They do no recommend a pilot hole size, so you have to eye ball it for yourself.Everything feels secure and sturdy.",0,Negative

Has many parts to facilitate mounting many different monitors or televisions. Had my set installed and running within 3 hours from the time I opened the box. No problems with adjusting to different viewing angles. This would have been a 5 star product but there were only 3 #6 flat washers instead of 4 - required for my tv.  3 cent item at Lowes tomorrow. If I had a different TV to mount I might not have needed these washers.  Because of this minor aggravation, I inventoried every package in the box. my washer was the only shortage. No big deal",2,Negative
"So I have 3 of these in my house. They are really easy to install. Heavy duty system. I have no worries at all with this system. currently these mounts are holding up a 26"", 36"", and a 42"" with out any stress on it. If you are looking for a tv mount for a tv that is 42"" or smaller. Get this one.",3,Negative
"I have no complaints.  The mount is very adjustable, fit my TV with no difficulty, is sturdy, and installation was straightforward.",4,Negative
"Bought this for my sony 32 in TV, mounted it as per instructions and have had no problems with it so far. Can't beat the price.",4,Negative
"I bought this to mount a 26 inch Sanyo TV in my bedroom. I chose this bracket because it tilted downward and I needed to mount it about 7 ft high on the wall. I do not have wood studs and tried to use the bolts and screw anchors that came with the kit, but I ended up with two big holes in my wall. I then purchased two 4 inch metal toggle bolts from the hardware store for about $5. After that, the bracket mounted to the hollow wall and would not budge. The toggle bolts were also easier to install since they screwed in and did not require a ratchet tool (the one that comes with the kit sucks). The directions are OK to follow but you have to read between the lines and figure some stuff out. The kit includes much more hardware than you will need, but they are trying to provide you with whatever your TV set will require. I had to try four different screws before I found the ones that fit my set. I am a female with a bad back and I was able to install this by myself while standing on a step ladder. Of course now I have to patch two large holes with spackle, orange peel, and paint. If I had just used the toggle bolts to begin with, I would not have to patch what I screwed up. If you do not know what a toggle bolt is, it's a metal bolt with a large V bracket that attaches to it inside the wall and opens up so whatever you hang on that wall is NOT going to ever come off. The HDMI cable that comes with it is a bonus since you can end up paying $6 to $30 for that depending on where you buy it.",0,Negative
"This works, but sags a little with play in the joints and flex, but the main issue I have is that the center of the plate on the television isn't the same as the part on the wall! so... you guessed it, I messed up the layout. I think that's a dumb design choice.",0,Negative
Although it was very sturdy the design of the bracket left much to be desired. The way they designed it makes it difficult to screw the mounting hardware into the wall.  They also didn't provide the correct screws needed to mount onto my TV. so I had to make some custom spacers and buy screws from a local hardware store.  it did what I needed at the end of the day after some frustration. Definitely much better products on the market but will get the job done if you are on an extremely cheap budget.,0,Negative
"This is not a complaint just a few tips to note when you get this mount:- You will need to loosen the joints or use a WD-40 pin on them because this bad boy is stiff and will not swing easily.- Take the plastic end caps off the nuts until you are finished mounting.The only bad part of this mount is that the bottom hole is not just a hole its about an inch long horizontal slot.  This can't be a pain in the butt to get it to align, and if it is not very tight it will move on the wall when the tv swings.  I think they should have just made this a single hole in my opinion!Overall this mount is great worth the price and then some.",0,Negative
"For a single person mounting a 45lb I found it difficult. A hanger bracket with a screw lock would have been much easier for the last step. The single arm also can't seem to support the weight when extended at all. The wall bracket stays level but the arm will bend down and turn.UPDATE Apparently adjusting the TV angle unscrewed the main ball joint bolt to the point where it was literally hanging in by a few screw threads. In light of this, tightening stripped the bolt and I don't trust the design at all anymore. My TV is on the floor until I get something else better",0,Negative
I bought this for a 32&#34; Vizio and the installation was a breeze. There was enough screws that you shoudl have no problem finding the right ones. Most of the bad reviews stated that they could not get theres level. My advice is to not use the level that is supplied. I tried that one out on my stove (which i know is level) and it showed i was off about 1/4&#34;. I then got out my own level and proceded to throw the one provided in the trash. I needed no adjustment to either the arm or the swivel and mine is perfectly level. (note vizio is 32&#34;). This mount is quite sturdy and seems to be well built.,0,Negative
The mount is great BUT is not good for small TV's. I bought this to mount my 22 inch LG TV but it is so large that it stuck out beyond the top of the TV and covered all of the inputs at the bottom. The price was so good that I just took my saws-all to it and cut it down.,0,Negative
"All you really need to know...when sitting flush against the wall, your monitor will sit approximately 2.5&#34;-3&#34; to the right or the to left of where you screwed it into the wall. this is because the mounting plate attached to your monitor would be in the way of the hinge closest to the wall making the monitor sit uneven against the wall. so to compensate, make sure you screw the mount 2.5&#34;-3&#34; to the right or left of where you want to be viewing your screen.&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;ALSO&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60; Get different drywall anchors if you have no stud to screw into...the ones that come with the mount wont work, and if they do, i wouldn't trust it to hold up my costly investment. The ones i am using are 1/4&#34;S Wall anchors for 3/8&#34;-1/2&#34; thick drywall. they generally come with different screws that will fit the mount, but this ,makes no difference.Great Product otherwise. comes with an HDMI cord and Level??...What a generous brand!Thank you VideoSecu!-Jesse",2,Negative
"I made the mistake of assuming the TV mount would fit the back of my TV with reading the instructions.  However, after reading the specs on my vizio 37&#34; tv (10225033022) I saw that it was a 510mmx200mm mounting scheme.  I was able to get it to work though.  I recommend putting in the screws that actually go into the TV first, then maneuver the brackets around until you can can attach the bracket screws to the center section.",0,Negative
"Poor planning when engineered for installation.  The wall attachment plate is too short to drill the two main screw support holes clear of the  pivot swivel.  The main rotating pin, blocks ability to use any other tool except the paper thin stamped hex wrench they included with the equipment; which is expected to screw in the 1/3 in x 3&#34; screw into wood support.  ... Just VERY POOR engineering.  I only keep it because after all the effort to get it installed, I fear the idea of having to ever remove it.  Maybe that's the manufacturer's hope for buyer's accepting keeping the rack; they forgot though that we can now go viral about the crummy engineering.  I've installed 4 other models, and this one is differently the worse.",0,Negative
"I used this to mount an inexpensive 32&#34; TV on the wall above a door. It is in the right place to see the TV from the bed. The mount works, is adjustable in several ways and looks like it will hold up. The instructions are factually correct, but reallistically, there are four bolts to connect the TV to mount and two lag screws to connect the mount to the studs in the wall. It took less than 30 minutes. Like HDMI cables, these mounts are sold reasonably on line and with a ferocious markup at the big box stores.",4,Negative
"Arrived a day early.  Instructions were complete and it was easy to install.  All possible screws included and the HDMI cable is a huge plus.  The only negative is that I'm not sure I like this type of wall mount in my bedroom, however that's on me as I knew exactly what I was getting.",4,Negative
strong and sturdy. Only negative I have found with it is you have to use the &#34;wrench&#34; that comes in the box to get the thing mounted to the wall. A regular wrench will not fit past some of the hardware to screw it tight against wall.,0,Negative
"Installed it easily. Drilled three holes into the wall, screwed this in, and hooked up the TV to it, and that's it. It was simple. You might have to adjust the looseness of the joints to ensure you can comfortably and smoothly swivel the TV around. But other than that i've had no complications whatsoever.",0,Negative
The wall mount is strong and very reasonably priced.  My box was missing the screws required to put the extension arms on. It is very frustrating when you order something and parts are missing. The directions could be better.,4,Negative
"So, after getting a stud finder, measuring where I can put my TV, drilling pilot holes, and lining up the wall bracket, I began the process of screwing in the wall bracket. It is at this point that I discovered that the endcaps on the swivel mechanism block the screw from going all the way into the wall. Only about 1/2 inch of screw went in before it got blocked by an endcap; enough to ""securely"" fasten the bracket to drywall. Perhaps this is what the many other reviewers saying the screws aren't long enough are talking about? I could not believe my eyes, but it's true; the self-tap lag screw cannot get past the swivel endcap. Totally unacceptable for something that I need to trust to hold up a big, heavy television.",0,Negative
"I didn't expect this type of top quality construction from something manufactured in China, yet it is. The only functionality that I wish it had was vertical movement. You can adjust the vertical viewing angle, though; just can't raise or lower the monitor. It comes with a lot of hardware for mounting, so no worries about purchasing it.",2,Negative
"Bought this mount given the overall good reviews but I am dissapointed after using this mount.The mounting screws are giant 10mm hex end screws. There are two major show stoppers here. 1) 10mm holes are an overkill given the weight of today's LED panels. It requires us to drill a large hole in the wall. 2) The hex end screws need to be turned in with a wrench. It would have been easier if these were phillips head as we could then drill in the screws with a power drill. It took me almost 30 minutes to turn the hex end screws fully into the wall anchor (plug). And at the end of all that work, the wall plate wobbles slightly from left to right, giving a feeling on insecurity (that the LED panel would drop one fine day)",0,Negative
Very sturdy and sits nicely on the wall. Great price and had no trouble installing this on the wall. No problems so far,4,Negative
"Easily wall mounts my 32&#34; TV. Easy to install myself. Mounting to one stud only dos not seem to be a problem. I would give it 5stars, however there no adjustment (elongated hole) in the top mounting. Because I did this myself, I got the holes a little off. I have the lower hole at its full swing and still need a little more adjustment to make it really straight. My fault, not bad enough to worry about, but still there.",2,Negative
"My ONLY complaint about this product is that while installing, it can be hard to access one of the lag bolts provided. Other than that, it works just fine. It's a nice touch that they include a small, cheap level!",0,Negative
"This thing is solid, holds my TV up with no sag, no sweat.  Granted, it's not a very heavy TV.",0,Negative
"I was waiting for something like this to come out to mount my TV on.  I prefer this full motion, so that no matter where I'm sitting in the room, I can swing it that way.  Can also avoid the sunlight with that.  Can't beat the price.....I spent over $100 for the first one I bought at Target",2,Negative
"Don't let the price fool you. I bought this to mount my 42"" LCD. Couldn't be easier. I predrilled the holes in the wall through the stud, put the center screw into the wall, and screwed the mount into the back of the tv. I then hefted the tv (38 pounds)up and on to the first screw (keyhole design on center screw), and my wife put the top and bottom screw in. Done! How much easier does it get?",0,Negative
"I bought this item to mount a 40"" LCD Television and I would rate it as adequate. I would be hesitant to use it to mount anything heavier than a 40"" TV with the supplied screws or mounting hardware. The mounting arm itself is heavy duty. It allows a free range of motion, but should be noted that it does not allow the TV to be completely flat  Oddly, it comes with mounting screws and inserts for ""concrete""... perhaps they mean drywall?",2,Negative
"Was able to mount it to my 32 inch jvc televison with no problems, and the setup looks very good after the mount.",4,Negative
So versatile that I don't think there is a TV out there that it wouldn't work with I was looking set up two tvs a 26&#34; LG and  32&#34;  Sony was able to use this with no problem,2,Negative
"Bought it to go into a bathroom and hung a 24&#34; flat screen on it.  It goes up just fine but the cantilevered arm is not strong enough to hold the TV straight when pulled off center and there is no twist adjustment to fix that.  Had they designed a set screw type adjustment into the attach mechanism it would rate a higher rating.  However, considering the price, its a good hanger for the money and if you aren't real particular about the tilt of the TV when its extended.",0,Negative
I bought this for a 32 in. Samsung Smart TV. I used a finish nail to find the stud. I did not need the electronic stuff. Read and follow the instructions exactly as the are listed and you will have no problems with it.,4,Negative
I mounted the TV in the corner of our living room and needed something that would give me all kinds of adjustability. This unit was very straight forward and had no problems doing the job myself. It even came with a FREE magnetic level. Okay...so it says that it is included in the description but between the 15 different mounts I was looking at I wasn't interested in the accessories.,4,Negative
"Its not as great as it's says it is. I wouldn't buy another one, that's for sure. It's kind of wimpy",0,Negative
"I bought a few of these to install TV's of various sizes.  The largest is 42"" and went up without a hitch.  I highly recommend it - very easy to do by yourself (on smaller TVs) and no complaints at all.",4,Negative
I used this for the 32&#34; Samsung TV in my guestroom. I have no regrets and installation is as easy as could be,4,Negative
I purchased this for my dining room that also has a couch/sitting area to one side.  The mount allows us to turn the TV to point towards the table for guests or to direct back to the seating area.It is hard to find a standard locked in place mount for the price and this does so much more.,2,Negative
"Every quality you want in a mount. Installation is an absolute breeze. Mount has a low profile and allows movement of the TV in almost every direction. For the price, you can not beat this mount.",4,Negative
Tried to do the macho thing and skip the detailed instructions and ended up wasting about an hour. Once I backtracked and followed them I realized I could have mounted it in less then an hour.  Very solid and plenty of choices to mount onto other brands of tv. So many screws leftover though :-(,2,Negative
"I bought this because the specifications said it could handle TVs up to 55 inches and 85 pounds.  My TV is 54 inches and 45 pounds.  When my contractor took it out to install it, though, he pointed out that it only connects to one wall stud, and was in danger of breaking off the wall at some point.  So I had to go buy another, sturdier wall mount.",2,Negative
exactly what we were looking for.  We got this on a spur the moment idea and have no regrets for this purchase.,3,Negative
THe bracket works.  It holds the TV sescurely albeit a little farther from the wall than advertised.  The problem is the mounting plate.  The screw head should be replaced with bolt heads so that the final one can be screwed in while the TV is mounted.  Its impossible to screw it in with the TV mounted.,0,Negative
"Walk away from this terrible mount.I have a few mounts around the house and office for LCD screens.  I really like to get monitors up and out of the way.  As well, I like them to be secured in case of earthquake or jostling AND, at the same time, fairly maneuverable.  This mount will get your TV on the wall, but it will not feel secure and it will be exceedingly difficult to adjust once it is up.The only things going for this mount are that it is cheap and it comes with all the screws and washers that you'd need.  That said, let me list the negatives.  The overall design is awful.  First off, it mounts to a stud with two bolts.  I am a firm believer that 3 to 4 vertical bolts are necessary to properly secure a television.  There is no way to modify the mount to add a third bolt.  Once in place, it cannot be adjusted.  I mean, it says it can be.  It looks like it can be.  But you can't turn the damn adjustment knob.  Stupid, stupid design.  Anyway, it took three people to get a TV mounted.  The trick is to attach the TV after the mount is adjusted.  Completely backwards, but whatever.  Keep in mind that fine tuning the adjustment, once everything is together is impossible.Also, once everything was all tightened up, the TV was wobbly. Even the slightest touch sent it bouncing.  The problem is that the TV is really secured with one vertical bolt.  Yes, you read that right.  Your several-hundred dollar purchase depends on one Chinese pot metal bolt.  Now, luckily for me, the two TVs that I mounted were about 35 pounds.  Anything more would surely be a huge risk.I would have sent these awful pieces of stamped junk back had I not been in a huge time crunch.  I had to keep them, but I will replace them within the year (if they last that long ... and I'm only half joking!).",2,Negative
"For the price, I did not expect a 5 star product, and this unit will certainly do.  The shame is that for no additional cost, the designers could have made this a 5 star product.  It's a bit too snug to the wall,  severely limiting the  L/R swivel, limited even more, if you tilt the unit downward. Leaving just a 1/2 inch more space for the nut that connects the wall bracket to the Vesa mount would have made the unit much easier on the fingers to assemble, and at the same time, would have permitted a little extra L/R tilt.In all, it's fine for my 32&#34; LCD.",2,Negative
"all and all if your looking at this you probably looked at the glass shelves also , spend the extra $$theres no place to run or hide the wires , the arms don't seem like they would hold more than a cable boxif your goin stack components  I don't think it will holdI bought a wall mount of the same company , also junkjust spend a little extra , know I wish I had",1,Negative
"This mount relies on the straps to hold the arm extenders to the wall-mounted bracket that your expensive electronic device is sitting on. Either someone cut it and then sent it back for a return, or the product deserves even a full star less because the strap is at least 6 to 8 inches to short to be useable. Absolutely impossible to thread through the plastic catch, even with fine tools because there's not an inch of strap to spare. Since it's already mounted to the wall, I'll look for another strap. A shame, because it's otherwise a decent minimalistic wall mount that seems to hold the weight.",0,Negative
"I put this in my bedroom to get my old PS3 off of the floor. It may lack the fit and finish of some of the other wall mounts, but it's held my PS3 up for several months now.There is no place on this mount to hide your wires, so have a plan B for that, or be prepared to have loose wires running down to the component that you keep on it.",2,Negative
Only concern was that the strap used to lock down the device onto the arms was not well made and did not work. A safety pin and some modification made it work though.,3,Negative
"I bought this for a uverse receiver under a mounted TV. I didn't want to buy the higher dollar one, since this was just in our Master and not a game room or family room TV.The installation wasn't bad, but the screws and anchors provided were pretty terrible, did not fit right at all. And they provided stud screws, but no screws for the dry wall anchors... weird...The reason I gave this a 3, is because it's not a typical wall mount like I'm used to seeing in the higher price range, where they have a place to feed wires through. This one has no place for that, so the wires will be off the side, shown above it or below it.If you don't care about a little showing its a not a big deal, I didn't really mind that much.The BIGGEST reason I gave this a 3 star, is because one of the arms that are supposed to hold the device is bent down a bit, so the device that sits on it is not totally level, which is a bit irritating. Over all I'm semi-satisfied with it. The seller themselves were great, fast response, fast shipment, so nothing against them.",3,Negative
"Very nice mount but the only thing is you can mount it close to anything like another one for stacking or near a cable outlet, TV mount etc. at least 4 inches away because after the metal mount is installed you have have enough room to slide the plastic trim over it from the top and bottom.  It won't snap on straight on so just leave yourself at least 4 inches away from anything where you mount it.  The arms do slide out but if you have anything over a foot and half  would need to maybe bolt the extender arms so they won't move out anymore when they get close to the end of their retraction.  They could slide on out the rest of the way.  There is no stop for them.",2,Negative
"Its quite simple really.  Screw it to the wall under the TV, spread the two arms which are adjustable and I was able to fit a full size bluray on it no problem.  It just works as expected and was easy to install.",4,Negative
"I paired it with the VideoSecu LED LCD Articulating Wall mount. Easy to install, adjustable for the size of the device on it. No complaints.",4,Negative

"This is exactly what I needed to mount my flat screen television to the inside of my entertainment cabinet. I did not use the mounting screws as they were too long, and purchased my required length at the hardware store.The mounting plate with post is adequate, as is the back of television VESA mounting plate, but I found the swivel mechanism to not be beefy enough at the juncture where it permits rotation of the television. For this reason, I knocked off 2 stars.For my project, none of the extensions were utilized.My mounted flat screen television still has adequate ventilation above after installation.All the necessary nuts, bolts, and screws were included.",2,Negative
"It's an okay mount once together, but it's ridiculous to have to put it together in the first place.  I've purchased a couple different mounts in the past, one was this style but came basically all together.  This one comes in many different pieces, takes about 1/2 hour to put together (finding everything in the packaging is part of that time).  It's also lighter weight than the others I've got, doesn't feel as strong.  It will be sufficient for the TV I got, but I wouldn't buy this again, especially at the price.  Should be like a $10 mount, considering the assembling necessary.  I'd give this probably a 3-star except for the fact that I mostly went off of ratings and apparently old reviews, and after I've actually got it on the wall I checked some more recent reviews to see that it has totally changed .  Many of the old reviews are what seems to be on a heavier, one-piece mount, not this thing.",0,Negative
"This mount comes with all the pieces necessary to attach it to your TV and to the wall. It can be adjusted to fit any size TV as well. It has wood screws and concrete screws but if you have a metallic stud behind the wall, you'll need additional pieces. It even comes with a mini leveler with a magnetic edge so you can adjust the mount with both hands! Beware though that if you use the tilt function, the cables connecting to your TV might get squished against the wall. Not a huge issue but just a FYI if you're worried about damaging cables.",2,Negative
"This is a great TV mount. It is very basic and externally low priced compared to other mounts. I had to re-mount it with a couple of 2X4s. This will need done if most of your cabling ports are in the back and not on the side. As is there was not enough clearance and my cables were damaged. (my fault, I saw the problem and did not re-mount at the time.",1,Negative

"Very awkward to put together. Instructions we not that good. Since it is not rigid, it was difficult to make level. I put it together incorrectly several times before nailing it and I have hung probably 10-12 TVs. Although I have used numerous Cheetah mounts and love the brand, I would not use this mount again, ever.",1,Negative
"Only reason I didn't give a higher rating is because it won't let the vesa 100 x 100 TVs sit in the center. Because the way this mount is assembled, with two separate pieces screwed together, the tv with vesa 100x100 must sit either 3 or so inches to either the left or right of dead center.However, it is a great deal for what you get! I mounted it to the beams (16inches), and I could hang from it (200 lbs) without it coming from the wall!",2,Negative
"As some others have said, you get what you pay for. Assembly was difficult to figure out from written instructions and the lousy small diagrams. You are better off just figuring it out for yourself.They give you a lot of parts, but still had to go to the hardware store because Sony has depth restrictions.But it worked.",0,Negative
I was a little hesitant based on price alone.. have you priced these at best buy? I ordered one to be safe.. and immediately ordered 2 others for my house. My In Laws also purchased 2 of these and can't be happier. I am not sure of the quality of the HDMI cord that came with it.. I haven't found any use for a 6 foot HDMI cord that is blue!,4,Negative
"As far as holding up a TV on the wall, I guess you could say it's great...getting the TV up there and stable is another story.  The safety screws that need to be tightened are so far up a normal screw driver cannot reach.  Not to mention the space between the TV and the wall was less than an inch.  Not a whole lot of room to work.  We had to Frankenstein a screwdriver together to screw in these screws.  It was ridiculous.  The shaft of the screwdriver had to be almost a foot long!  I guess we got it screwed in, quite frankly there's no way to really know because you sure as heck can't see back there.Hopefully we'll never have to take our TV down.  If we do, we'll probably just have to rip the dang thing off the wall.",0,Negative
"This is, my worst purchase ever. Even worse than the time I bought my blind uncle a pair of glasses. Or the time I insured my hair, just to realize it didn't cover fire damage. The point is, three hours later this is installed. With the use of 4 washers of my own, because their &#34;star&#34; washers were as flimsy as a soda can, and the wrong size. The bolts, too short to include the spacers. I am using it on a 32&#34; television, and wouldn't recommend it for mounting a toaster oven. Do not buy this for anything bigger than your kitchen utensils.",0,Negative
"The main problem with this product is that the latch used on the bottom of the tv mounts, the part that 'hooks' to the bottom is done so with a screw.  Unless you have freakishly small hands and wrists, you are not going to reach the screw with the tv mounted to the wall.  There is less than two inches at a flat angle.  Also, the flange that the screw attaches to is a bit too long and it digs into the wall it is mounted to.  I made the mistake of placing my tv on the wall, then adjusting it left and right until it was properly centered, this created two large gouges in the sheetrock.

(although some of the screws didnt fit my brand new panasonic 50"", strange, but I just bought 4 replacements at Loews.But the HDMI cable is NOT HDCP COMPLIANT... so I got it all mounted up and happy with wires hidden after testing on some movie that didnt have drm, and then I played a movie that did, and no go.  Had to replace cable.Not really the cable's fault, HDCP should die in a fire, but given it exists, easier to have a more recently made cable.",1,Negative
This thing is great. I hate to give it such a good review. I don't want the price to go up. Talk about simple. It also allows me to easily change TV's if I want. it will work for all my TV's and large monitors. I can't believe there are any negative reviews. I read them but I'm trying to figure out what they are referring to unless it's all operator error.,2,Negative
Lower cost than similar products and even includes an HDMI cable.  A little more assembly required but worth it.  The only problem was that I had to purchase longer screws to mount the TV because the included screws were too short.  Not a big deal since the screw size is available at the local hardware store.,4,Negative
It is great now that it is on the wall but it was very hard to put it there. The screws that support the bottom of the bracket (the part securing the TV to the wall) were very difficult to screw up with a standard sized screw driver. In the end I was only able to run up one of the screws as the other was inaccessible.,0,Negative
"Don't get jipped by buying some expensive mount! If you install this correctly you will not be dissapointed. I mounted my 60&#34; Samsung LED tv that i bought for $2,000 on this and i am not even a bit nervous of it breaking on me.I literally hung on the bracket once it was mounted on the wall to test if it can hold the weight (i'm about 170 lbs.) and it didnt budge one bit. Just make sure that you have the tv screwed on a stud as specified.",0,Negative
"Well made product, Packing needs improvement. Product arrived in 1 day with regular shipping. Used for 42"" LG LED and all bolts and screws included. Missing HDMI cable but company fixed the problem.",4,Negative
"The mount is sturdy and easy to install. However, the design is flawed.First, I don't see why the bracket alone comes in 6 separate pieces one has to screw back together. Second, the fit on the 2 vertical braces is very bad. The vertical braces are too wide to fit properly in the indentations of the horizontal pieces. Even with rotating, I could not make them flush. Second, they use tiny short screws that further complicate assembly. I'm quite handy with tools but just assembling the bracket took 15 minutes!",0,Negative
"I put this up last night, along with my new Samsung 60"" TV.  The mount was easy to install and seems to be doing a good job of holding the TV up.  I had to do a little ""framing"" work inside the ""entertainment center"" opening above my gas fireplace -- that opening in my 14-year-old home was built for the deep, boxy TVs of the time.  (More on that below, if any are interested.) My only minor ""complaint"" about the Cheetah mount as matched to the Samsung TV is that there weren't enough plastic washers with the right size opening to make snug the screws that hold the mount arms to the back of the TV. As someone said in an earlier review that they did, I used my drill to ream a larger hole in the 4 plastic washers that had the next largest openings, which gave me a total of 8 usable washers, 2 for each screw.  That still wasn't quite snug, so I used 4 flat metal washers -- one for each screw -- I had around the house to get it snug. I don't fault Cheetah, because there's a limit to how many washers they can put in a package, but the purchaser should be aware that you may need to have some of your own washers to make a snug connection between the mount arms and the TV, at least for a Samsung 60"" slim LED TV.Here's the ""framing"" I did:  on each side of the TV opening above my fireplace, 1.5 inches back from the face of the opening, I screwed a 2x4 piece to the inside wall of the opening.  Then I screwed two pieces of 2x6 across the front of the 2x4s, with about a 3 or 4 inch gap between the 2x6 pieces.  I screwed the top rail of the Cheetah mount to the top 2x6 piece and the bottom rail to the bottom 2x6 piece.  The power and HDMI cables run through the gap between the 2x6s.  It took some careful measuring and calculating to make sure the TV (overall and with its power and cable ports)and the opening between the two horizontal 2x6 pieces would be where I wanted them.  The other thing I did was to supplement the top rail lag screws, which went all the way through the 2x6s, with an additional lag bolt on each side.",0,Negative
"this mount does it's job. Easy to put together lightweight and sturdy. I have a 55"" led TV and it holds it up with problem. comes with lots of screws and anchors depending on your situation with or without finding the studs in your wall.Hard to screw in the bottom screws to the mount once you put the TV up though.",2,Negative
"For the price, this product fills a niche.  The construction of the mount is descent, but the instructions, or lack of instructions leave a lot to be desired.  I would have paid and extra $4 for more than a half sheet of paper with the mount displayed already put together.  I had to pull it off the wall to turn pieces around.  The assortment of screws did not fit my Pioneer which has a standard mount.  If you purchase this mount, make sure you check and double check the rails before you screw them into your wall.PS. The level that comes with the mount is nowhere near the displayed item.  It is a single bubble tube that snaps into the back  of the top rail.",2,Negative
"March 2010: I am terribly disappointed in this purchase. While it was a huge savings at 35 USD, the old adage ""You get what you pay for"" proves itself true once again.First off, as other owners have blogged here, the install booklet is horrible. There are part names mentioned by name (eg Lag screws) that are NOT named in the Parts Listing or Diagram.Secondly, and most importantly, the pre-drilled holes DO NOT ALIGN properly with a 16"" or 24"" stud distances. What I mean is my wall has stud CENTERS that are exactly 24"" apart. Regardless, even if they were 16"" apart, the pre-drilled holes in the Cheetah mount would FORCE ME to be WAY OFF center .. close to the edge of BOTH studs. While that might work, it's terribly close to the edge and therefore UNSAFE .. especially if the screw ends up not going in perfectly straight therefore coming out of the side of the stud.This is a HUGE oversight in the hardware design. This product appears to originate from Assai Photo Supply - browse to:  [...]/Assia-Photo-SupplyI am very displeased with this purchase. I would much rather spend 100 dollars MORE, to know that my children will be SAFE while walking under / near to the mounted TV.===========**UPDATED** See my follow-up post below. In short, the install booklet includes a diagram showing where to place the lag screws for mounting to the studs. The small holes CAN NOT be correct, as they do NOT align with 16"" or 24"" spaced studs. Instead, use the oval holes, despite that they aren't perfectly aligned either. Sadly, I got the idea from an image I found on some other 3rd party website.===========",2,Negative
Can't go wrong here - cheaper then almost any other wall mounts but very sturdy.  I have no complaints at all.,4,Negative
"I was skeptical about buying such an inexpensive mount to hang my new 46"" Panasonic plasma; but when it arrived I found it to be made of very heavy duty steel and was confident it could hold the TV with no problem.However when I went to mount the brackets to the back of the set I discovered that none of the enclosed screws were long enough if used with the plastic spacers. I went to three different hardware stores looking for 8mm screws with a 1.25 thread that were 3"" to 3 1/4""long to no avail. the longest I could find were approx. 2 1/2"" which forced me to buy much thinner nylon washers to use as a spacer. By having the brackets that closely mounted to the TV it has defeated the purpose of the tilt mechanism which is now very difficult to access and also impossible to access the cords and cables without first taking the TV from the wall which is why I bought a tilting mount in the first place.The part that attaches to the wall does not line up evenly with 16"" studs forcing me to have slightly more on one side than the other. This is not too much of a factor as long as all four lag bolts are firmly into studs as the TV can be adjusted to right or left when hanging.My guess is that this mount was not designed for the american market as it is all metric. Having said all that, it is a very sturdy wall mount given the price but someone who is not much of a do-it-yourselfer may be frustrated with the lack of appropriate hardware and the overly simplistic sheet of directions. I will continue to scour any home and hardware stores for longer metric bolts/screws to replace the ones that I substituted.Note: Mine did not come with a free level but I own a decent level already and wasn't too disappointed on that count.Upate 5-1-2012I was contacted by Cheetah Mounts and have been told that their mounts have since been redesigned and additional hardware has been included to accomodate more TVs so there would be nothing more to purchase.  They also offered a refund for the screws that I previously bought!The mount has held up well and I would purchase from them again.",0,Negative
This mount comes in pieces that you have to put together before putting up on the wall.  I got it put together and ready to put on the wall I had it all squared up but once you start tightening it down it goes all to hell.  It does kind of look like a bow tie and is extremely difficult to get level.  After messing with it for an hour I got it as level as I could but the right side is still a little off.  I don't think I'd buy this mount again.,0,Negative
I received this the other day and got my 42&#34; Vizio on the wall in about an hour.The instructions are a bit hard to understand but if you just take your time and read/look at the pictures you can get it figured out.The box does come with many different size screws so follow the letters on their packages for your installation.,0,Negative
"We purchased this initially because the cost is so much better compared to the TV mounts you purchase at the major retail stores.  This comes in a small box, and with pieces you have to put together with nuts and bolts.  Because of the way this is designed, there are no mounting holes in the middle of the device, and the wall stud in our house with directly in the middle of where we wanted to mount the TV.  Which left all the other available mounting holes in dry wall.  I disliked the cheap quality of having to put this together, and the fact that we couldn't mount it.  We stopped in the middle of the project, and went to Target to purchase a better quality mount.  It did come with a longer HDMI cable, and two small levels, neither of which would've been helpful for mounting the device.Overall, my husband and I were very unhappy with the product.  We took everything back apart, repackaged it, and returned it.",3,Negative
"Looking for a budget price tilt mount?This one will do.For the price,it does the job,but the tilt adjustment is difficult to reach and tighten on a VESA 200x200 setup on my 42""Visio.I bought this mount expecting this to be a problem,and in that respect am not really let down.I needed a tilt mount at 15 degrees to make 3D more watchable from my bed.It came with all the required hardware to install it and it all went well and installed quickly.I have had and installed several different tilt mounts over the years for myself as well as others.I would suggest using a real level at least 24 inches long(not use the included ones. When you locate where your wall studs are and determine your desired placement for viewing,draw a light pencil line with a real level,then flip the level and check it for accuracy.Mark the holes for the top to pre drill 2 holes for the 2 larger lag bolts in the centers of the studs dead center on your level line on the wall.Be sure you use a bit smaller than the thickness of the lag bolts threads.Use the washers and attach the 2 top bolts.Do not overtighten the bolts,just snug enough to recheck with a level on top,then tighten so they wont move anymore.Pre drill for the smaller lower 2 bolts usiing a smaller bit again,place the smaller washers on the bolts and snug them up as well.Attach the brackets to the back of the tv(be sure the tilt adjuster screws face outward),back off on the bottom rail set screws on the wall mount attach your cables and power plug and hang your tv.Tighten the bottom rail set screws and you are done.It will stay at about 15 degrees.Changing the tilt on this model is not much of an option,so just tighten the tilt screws as much as you can and you're done.If doing this is too difficult,have someone else do it so you will be sure your tv will not detach from the wall(a bad day for sure.)Overall, as I have said...a decent mount for the price,but if your tv is over 42 lbs,choose a heavier mount.This one did what it needed to do for me at a budget price.The included 10 ft 1.4 HDMI etherenet cable works well with my Panasonic 3D Blu-ray player.",0,Negative
I gave it four stars for the cheap price and I knew what I was getting.  The quality is not that great.  I had to grind a piece of the steel to get it to assemble properly.  Don't use the level that comes with the kit.  I used the level and I could tell by eye that the level was off.  Used another level and straightened things out.,0,Negative
The included HDMI cable is junk. The level is cute but useless. The design is poor as when the TV is tilted forward there is NO way to utilize the lower locking screws sooo my 60 inch TV is hanging on the top lip of the bracket only.,0,Negative
"This wall mount is great for the price! It's easy to install and very solid construction. It took two people about two hours to install this but you could do it in less than an hour if you're handy with tools. We're not!Anyway, the only negatives have to do with the instructions. One: No list of required tools. Make sure you have the right size socket for the lag bolts and the right size drill bits, ahead of time. Two: They say to set the tilt of the TV first and then attach the TV to the wall plate. But if you tilt the TV all the way, then you can't reach the safety screws at the bottom of the wall mount in order to tighten them. So tighten first, then tilt.",0,Negative
"No reason to pay more for a simple TV mount you'll never see. But, do note that this is fairly flush with the wall, and if you have cables that stick out from either the TV or the wall you'll want about another half-inch or so. But, if you don't, this is perfect for a flush look.",2,Negative

"When I saw it I was very disappointed, first it is built very cheap, i have bought 5 or 6 flat screen mounts and everyone has a solid back, this one has 6 cheap pieces that you have to screw together, and with my fat fingers it was almost impossible, will spend the extra 30 next time and go with another brand",1,Negative
"The Cheetah mount comes with all the hardware I needed (and quite a bit more) to mount my television on the wall. It was easy to assemble and mount with two exceptions. There are two vertical brackets that hold the top part of the wall mount to the bottom part of the wall mount. There is one screw in each end of the two brackets that hold everything together, one screw was missing. I found a screw I had in my ""junk"" drawer so it was not a big issue. The second problem was the mount did not have the built in level. The description and the box both said it had a built in level and there was a bulge where the level should have been but it was not there. It did come with a small magnetic level so I was still able to get it mounted to the wall level.",0,Negative
"Bought this to mount my 60 inch Vizio on the wall.It does the job well.  TV is secure.It's tight to the wall, so not easy to plug things in once it's mounted.",4,Negative
The mount was quick and easy to install.  Our 50&#34; tv feels solidly mounted to the wall.  The only negative I have would be the difficulty in tightening the screws that secure the tv to the mount.,4,Negative
"Build quality is very high, no need to worry that your TV is going to fall off the wall.  Comes with lots of hardware to support just about any type of mounting setup.  A few reviewers have said that its hard to assemble.  I have no idea what they are talking about... if it takes you more than 5 minutes to assemble maybe you shouldn't be trying to mount your own TV! Overall I love this mounting bracket and would give it my highest recommendation.",4,Negative
"I bought this to hang a 85 Lbs. 60"" LCD flat panel, which this is supposed to handle. While the installation was simple, (although I am not sure why they did not use the same size screws on the top and bottom brackets, which meant that you needed to drill two different size holes), the tilt setting for the bracket would not say at the upright position, no matter how tight I made the screws. I ended up placing a block of wood at the bottom of the TV to set the angle. Another point to note is that the bracket places the TV so close to the wall, the electrical plug, and cables could not come straight out of the wall, I had to put angle connectors on all the connections for the cables and electric plug to fit. I have this up for one week now, and appears to be holding. To bad the tilt does not work, I guess you get what you pay for.",0,Negative
"I'm going to give this thing 3 starts because it does work and works good but it is cheaply made, with little quality control since one of my arms was bent a the bottom where it needed to bolt to the back of the tv.Also, if you have an older LCD tv that you are wanting to use this mount on with tilt, then you might be out of luck.  The older LCD's, at least my 46"" Samsung, the plugs for your cables plug straight in rather than newer LCD/LED's where they plug in from the side.  The cables stick out on the older ones causing them to hit the wall which will keep it from tilting only so far.  I think you can buy adapters maybe for hdmi, but not sure about component?I'm not sure what the mounting holes on our tv are considered(maybe VESA 700x400 since that says it goes up to) but the brackets that bolt to the back of it had no adjustment left once bolting it up.  My other mounts all have had some extra adjustment to allow me to move the tv up or down more if it needed to be if the mount was not in the right spot.I don't know what the standard mounting height of mounts are but I always go up 54"" from the floor and draw a level line and attach the bottom of the wall mount to that that line.  This might not work for you, but for somebody putting one up for the first time, this might help you.  A smaller tv, might need to be a little lower, but you can probably also move the tv down on the mount if you need to.  I just think in my opinion that 54"" is a good baseline.All the screws were in the package and I did not use the cable but I am saving it for a rainy day.  The mount will take you a few minutes to put together and you will need a phillips screwdriver and a metric wrench for putting it together.The tilt method on this thing is kind of cheap and you will need a long phillips to adjust it and tighten it if you want to adjust it once it is on the wall.  The mount is just cheap and it is hard to get the tilt the same on both of them since there are no marks to go by and it might not tilt evenly but you can figure that out.  The last complaint I have is the security screws on the underside.  On most of the other mounts I have used, they have a latch or a screw that will hold it in place and keep the tv from even being pulled away from the wall at the bottom of the tv.  The screws on mine, tighten up but do not tighten all the way into the bottom of the mount which will still allow the the tv to be shifted on the mount or you will think the tv will want to pull off at the bottom.  It will not but I just wish the company would have used a longer screw to have it tighten into the bottom of the mount.  It's not going to come off though and the mount does hold the tv.This mount does sit closer to the wall which leaves less space between the tv and the wall so this might keep you from tilting the tv to the desired postition if your cables are in your way.  If this is a problem, try another mount.  Peerless is a very good mount and I have used them in the past but they are a little more than twice the price.Give the mount a try though and if you don't like it, you can always send it back.",0,Negative
"I recieved my mount yesterday. The instructions are not the bad. I have seen alot worse. After assembling the bracket I did realize that it will handle my Panasonic 55"" plasma with no problems. I did use my own level. I had trust issues with the provided level. Im see to many complaints thats its only 1.3"" from the wall. READ THE DESCRIPTION!! IT CLEARY STATES THAT!! Thats what I wanted. My HMDI inputs are on the side of my TV. The 1 complaint I do have and agree with alot of reviews is the safety screws on the bottem TV bracket are a bear to get too. You need a long philips head to get to them and being so close to the wall, well its a pain. But for 27.99 it's a hell of a deal. It also comes with a cheetah 10 ft. HMDI cable. I also ordered 2 of these cables separately. Compaired to my overpriced monster HDMI cable I could not tell a difference in picture quality. Picture is top notch and the reviews on these are great. So I have an extra one. So think about it. Your saving a $100 dollars or more buying this bracket and dont forget about the 10 ft. HDMI cable your getting too. IT'S A STEAL!",0,Negative
I saw this has been very highly rated over the past few years. Goes on easily..instructions could be a little clearer though. Only complaint is that my HDMI cables come straight out of the back of my TV and because its so close the wall you really have to bend the HDMI cable to get it to make the clearance from the wall.,1,Negative
I bought this to hang a 50&#34; Vizio that I got for Christmas.  The only thing wrong was that the people (wife and I) hanging the TV could not figure out which wall they wanted it hung on.,3,Negative
the only down side to this mount is that it only turns up and down and no angles.good buy,2,Negative
"I have 2 of these. I'm happy with the mount but there's not enough room behind the TV for wires to come out. In fact, you may even have to get HDMI cables that have 90 degree angles to the connectors.At the bottom of the TV where most of the connectors are, there's literally 1/4"" space and there's no way to adjust it. It is what it it. But for $27 instead of $120 I made it work.",0,Negative
"Took 30 minutes to assemble and get everything to align properly after figuring instructions out, it is a cheap mount. I am hanging a 32 inch Samsung LCD and vertical brackets didn't align properly, the TV is mounted but no room to get to the adjustment screws, no matter how I hang the TV! However returning isn't an option cause its already mounted and don't want to patch holes and scared a new mount will not use same holes. The TV is wobbly because the vertical bars will not mount to TV flush, maybe I got bad mounts or vertical bars......",0,Negative
"Been on the wall for three months and still going.I guess as long as you know how to find wall studs, use a level, and use some basic tools, the installation is simple.  I had no problems getting this on the wall and the brackets mounted to my 52"" Sharp Aquos television.  It's a 2007 model LCD and weighs around 75lbs.  It feels sturdy on the bracket so I don't at all feel uncomfortable worrying if it's going to fall off.As this is a fairly basic and close mount, you'll likely want to connect everything to your TV before hanging it.  For me, there's not much room to get your hands behind the TV once it is mounted.",0,Negative
"There were several problems with this mount.  The instructions were very poor; just general directions (eg 'Find the bolts that fit your tv') and pictures were useless.  Bolts for attaching brackets to the tv were too long so I had to make spacers out of some spare nuts I had in my shop.  Also, a star washer was missing from the parts bag so I had to use the smaller ones. Flimsy construction.  Don't order this mount.",0,Negative
"Not impressed with this! It's sturdy, but I received a damaged product, had to carry to a welder to repair before installing.",1,Negative
"I decided to take my TV from the stand to the wall. Everything was delivered quickly and boxes were not damaged. All parts were with the packaging. The instruction could use improvement, but taking your time will aleviate any installation issues. The mount is low profile to the wall. The installtion was very simple until tightening the lower screws and trying to connect some wires and cables on the TV. Some came out as I put it on the wall, but I did the entire installtion alone. Pre-connecting wires will reduce that struggle. The screws on the bottom are a different story. A very tight fit and is a little time consuming.Overall, I am please with the new look of installtion on the wall. Product is very sturdy. I also purchased a wide channel cover to hide the wires. A stud finder is a must installing on drywall to hit the studs just right. You will need a drill if going into the studs.I am very pleased and gave it 4 stars because of the bottom screws. I debated 5 stars and was very close to rating it that way.",1,Negative
"Really great idea!  Hardware is packed in individual compartments in a plastic bag.  Everything is clearly labeled and easy to understand.  Easy to mount.  It comes with TWO levels to help get it mounted, and there are enough holes to hit most any set of wall studs.  Good price.  Would work if the parts were correct.  Hate that I had to send it back.The package came with one defective part.  One of the two arms had the bottom flange welded about an inch too close to the hook part of the arm.  Therefore, it would not match with the good arm and could not be secured to the wall bracket.  I didn't notice this problem until I was trying to secure the flange to the wall mount.But, here's the REAL problem.  Customer support was TERRIBLE.An email to sales@cheetahmounts.com had a reply from customerservice@altiaproducts.com signed 'assiamounts' and supposedly the shipment of a replacement part.  However, when the tracking number showed delivered, it was to a different city and state.  That's OK; mistakes happen.At this point, everything fell apart.  Next response wanted to know the eBay account information.  Uh, this is an Amazon transaction.  Then they needed all the information, again (I had previously sent PDF of invoice and picture of the problem).  All subsequent messages included apologies for not having the replacement part on the way.  But never another shipment.  One messages asked me to telephone them, but on about 6 attempts, I never got past the auto-attendant telling me I was ""next"" and then ""all reps are busy"" messages.  And they never returned the call.  No response, either, from an email to the assiacs@gmail.com address on the auto-attendant.It's three weeks after receiving the order and there's no resolution, so I have to return it to Amazon.

"Part of my work is installing TVs. I have used dozens of different mounts. This one is just OK. The biggest problem is it takes several minutes to assemble the main rectangle part of the bracket. Then that part isn't perfectly square. The other big problem is that once you mount the TV, the security screws on the bottom part of the bracket are blocked by the bottom of the TV. Again, I do this for a living and have a 10&#34; phillips screw driver just for this kind of thing. I recommend you spend a bit more and get an easier design to work with.",0,Negative
"Cheetah Mounts made several changes to the product in an obvious attempt to cut manufacturing and shipping costs. After opening the package to hang my latest television, I discovered that the top and bottom rails are no longer 1 solid piece of steel. They are now two pieces that need to be bolted together in the center by 12 screws, just so they can make the box smaller. The steel itself is much thinner now and instead of a powder coat finish, they are using cheap spray paint. There used to be a bubble level attached to the top bracket, in addition to a small torpedo level in the box. The mounted bubble level is now gone, and the torpedo level has been replaced with a cheaper one too. You used to be able to adjust the tilt of the mount using thumb levers. Those thumb levers are now gone, and have been replaced with philips screws, so now you need to try to hold a screwdriver in the 3&#34; gap between the wall and the television. Believe it or not, they even cut back on the lag bolts used to secure the mount to the wall. Now, instead of 4 large lag bolts, they now give you 2 large and 2 small. I used to be able to assemble one of these in 5 minutes; this one took 30.What's worse is they replaced the original Cheetah mount with this piece of crap, so they could keep all the 5-star reviews they had received on the previous bracket! What they should have done is listed it as a new product, as they have completely changed every aspect of the product and certainly the quality. Very deceptive practice!

"I used this to mount a 46&#34; Samsung LED to a wall in my den. It only took a few minutes to put together and was easily secured into wall studs with the supplied hardware. The only problem that I had was with the bolts supplied to secure the brackets to the TV. The holes on the TV were recessed and the bolts were not the right length. Inconvenient but not a huge problem, one quick trip to ACE and the screen was up.",2,Negative
"First,the main pictures are inaccurate.There are 6 metal pieces that have to be screwed and bolted together to form the rectangular piece that mounts to the wall.You need a small metric or adjustable wrench to fully tighten the very small nuts.The picture that is included in the instructions on how the vertical pieces of the rectangle fit in place are very hard to make out.If you do it wrong they won't lay flat and you'll have to take them apart again.Finally, I wouldn't trust this thing to hold a large 65"" plasma.I've put together 5 different types of mounts such as this and all the others(including an earlier Cheetah version)were much more well built.",0,Negative
"I've had it for nearly 3 years... it's still holding my 42 inch tv, and i'm about to put a 60 inch on it.So far so good, i've had ZERO problems, it was simple to install, if you're willing to drill into the wall, and comes pre packaged with everything basically perfectly.I will update within a few months if anything bad happens with my 60 inch plasma tv.",0,Negative
"i bought this for a 39"" tv, i think this is more geared for bigger tvs, 39"" is kinda big for the small mounts and kinda small for the big mounds like this.  I ended up only using one of each of the top and bottom brackets instead of 2.  the product is good but the assembly directions are awful.  it provides both written and illustrated directions but neither is very good.bottom line: good product, awful installation instructions",2,Negative
"I have 3 of these. They all work as planned.My gigantic 55 inch plasma (about 160 pounds) holds on this with no problem, only have two screws into a stud and the other two in drywall.

"This is an inexpensive mount suitable for light applications only. I recommend that you not trust the built in bubble level but provide a quality level of your own.  This bubble also prevents movement of the TV once mounted.  Everything is a light weight steel stamping with a black powder coat finish.  The boat level shown as part of this kit is NOT included.Assemble the 4 backing plate components into a single unit and mount using your own level.  Lag bolts are provided that will work with 2x4 wood or metal studs, pre-drill your holes.Mount the 2 hooking mechanisms to the back of the television. It is critical that you make sure that these are mounted in the same location - top or bottom of the screw hole.  The holes are bigger than the screws and will result in the television not being level otherwise.Hang, adjust the tilt where you want it to be and tighten the locking screws.  If you tighten the locking screws first you will not be able to get the tilt angle desired.Pros:  Inexpensive and does the job - Priced rightCons:  Lightweight - If you have bought other units such as the Sanus you will know the difference.  Oversized holes allow for alot of wiggle room and may require several adjustments to make right.",2,Negative
Hangs my 32 in flat screen TV on the wall with no issues. Set-up was a breeze - took me all of 5 minutes!,4,Negative
I must say that I bought 2 of the wall mounts and I don't like this one at all. I can't plug anything in the back of it. Not that everything is up and running I will never try and plug anything up in the back of my TV. Good thing the TV has all the plugs on the side of it. Still very hard to plug up. Not a fan of this thing at all I would buy the VideoSecu Tilt TV Wall Mount,0,Negative
"Package was missing a screw, but I was able to use one I had already.  Otherwise, 5 stars.  I have a 42&#34; Samsung and the brackets that mount to the TV were just large enough.  My TV was purchased in 2004, so I imagine the newer lighter LED/Plasmas might have closer mounding holes, but just a heads if you have anything larger than a 42.",2,Negative
"This is not the best mount out there but may be the best for the price. It seems a bit weak compared to others I have used but for what I paid I didn't expect it to equal a $100+ mount. Installation was smooth and mounting the tv went smooth but for one exception. The parts you have to turn to lock the mount to the viewing angle you choose are impossible to reach and turn with my tv mounted. I have a 50"" plasma so this may not be the case with a smaller tv. I had to guess where I wanted it positioned then lock it down and hang the tv. It took two attempts to get it where I wanted so it wasn't too bad. If the mount set the TV further away from the wall just a little more I may have been able to adjust it with the tv hanging. Also it has the tv so close to the wall that cable connections that come out the back are stressed slightly as the cables have to be bent to a 90 degree angle. This may be different on other  tv's that has connections pointing down rather than strait out of the back. Overall I'm happy with the mount for the price I paid and would by again. My LG 50PK750 weighs 65 lbs without the stand and it hasn't fallen so I have no complaints other than the nits mentioned above.",2,Negative
I wanted to mount a new flat screen on a wall with 3 studs.  I wanted the mount in the studs so I could then slide the mount left/right as needed to center the TV.  That left/right movement is limited to about 3in and does not move the full length of the mounting bar.  I guess this is for stability or something but otherwise it works perfectly and I have no fear of my 3 year old grabbing onto the TV and it getting pulled off the wall.,2,Negative
"I don't recommend this mount if your TV is 65inch or larger (I've used it with a 65 and 70 inch Vizio). It worked okay when I used it to to hang my old 42inch plasma for testing (it was able to fully tilt).It's just okay if used without the tilt, but in order to use the full tilt capacity with my 70inch TV I had to bolt risers made from 2x4 lumber to get the TV far enough away from the wall. Without the risers the bottom edge of the TV contacted the wall which prevented it from titling completely.  Another downside is that there isn't any means to adjust the set for level after hanging it on the mount (and making sure the mount is level doesn't mean that the TV will be level when hung on it). It's impossible to use the locking screws to secure the TV to the mount if the mount is tilted to full capacity, which is a design flaw. If I had to do it again, I'd buy an articulating tilting mount that allowed for leveling. I'm going to have to make some kind of shim to level my TV. Another ding on this Cheetah mount was that a nut and bolt had come undone and were rattling around inside the packaging. The upsides to this mount are its' low price and the included HDMI cable (which works perfectly).",0,Negative
"As many others have already said it likely will not include the separate bubble level that is described and pictured, and the bubble level that is built into the mount is useless.That said, it's a good product that goes together fairly easily.  The instructions have bad English but are still readable.  It comes with a bunch of bags of screws, washers, etc. and it did have the correct screws for my 40"" Sony Bravia XBR.  However I don't think it has enough variations for all tvs, so I'd be prepared to supply your own.  Get them before hand so you're not stuck there.  The mount mounts onto the wall with 6 large coarse threaded hex bolts, and included are 6 concrete anchors as well.  I was mounting mine into a stud/beam so no need for the anchors.It mounts to the wall very securely and there's absolutely no way it's coming off unless your bolts aren't anchored well.  Luckily my wall has a large horizontal beam running above the fireplace so I had no trouble hitting studs.  I don't recall if the bolt holes are 16"" apart (standard stud placement), but I assume they would be.The vertical brackets you see pictured then screw into the back of your tv with 4 smallish screws, and if anything this would be the weakest point, but this is no fault of the mount.  It just pales in comparison to the bolts that secure it to the wall.  Once the vertical bars are mounted to the tv you (and hopefully a friend) just lift it onto the mount and the vertical bars hook onto the horizontal mount rails.  You can tilt it from 0-10 degrees and a small hand crank on each side secures it in place.Make sure to attach your cables BEFORE you mount it on the wall, 'cause once it's up there you have very little clearance behind it, and the vertical bars block access from the sides.  I learned this the hard way after I lifted my 40"" 80 lb. LCD by myself onto the mount and then realized I couldn't gain access to the back to plug in the cables.Finally there are a set of phillips head screws that you screw in from the bottom to keep the hooks from coming back up and off the horizontal rails.  Of course the weight of the tv keeps this from happening, but you can imagine during an earthquake or something the screws would prevent that.  The screws were a little difficult to access once the tv was mounted, but I was able to get in there and cinch them down.Overall I'd say this mount is of good quality and while it doesn't include the bubble level it claims to (you should have your own anyway if you are mounting a tv), it's an exceptional value compared to all the others I've seen.  I almost went with a $70'ish dollar more well known mount, but thought I'd give this a try.  I'm glad I did.",0,Negative

"Well the only reason why I am giving this a 3 is because I couldnt use it, it was the wrong mount for my tv, so I feel a unjust writing any review for this and maybe i shouldnt.......I ended up giving it to my mother who is using it and no problems with it, the package was safe and had no problems putting it together.",3,Negative

"Great mount for the price. Very low profile. Only bad thing is I had problems with the HDMI cables out of both mounts I purchased. One Tv had white dots everywhere. I assumed this was interference since I ran power and HDMI cabled right next to each other. But then the cable guy couldnt get my other tv to work. I switched the cords out and no interference and no problems. Still a great deal for the mount, just dont count on the cables that are included.",3,Negative
"The product must be assembled. Easy to do, but odd.The tilt requires you to adjust a screw, however it is too weak to hold the angle with that one weak screw. Plus it is hard to get your hand in behind the tv to adjust. Your TV will hang tilted down, the only thing stopping it is when the bottom of the tv touches the wall. That will give you a two-three inch gap on top.Also, it mounts very tight to the wall, only a 1/2&#34; gap. So if you plug your tv into a socket behind the wall, you will have an issue, the plug will interfere with the mount.",2,Negative

"This comes unassembled and you need to screw the base plate together.The only issue I really have with this is the mounting arms use screws on the bottom to ""lock"" them onto the bracket.  I have another mount similar to this one that uses a spring loaded clamp to ""lock"" down.  The reason the screws suck is because it's difficult to get under there to tighten them to install (and loosen to remove). The other mount that uses a spring loaded clamp just locks on during install when you push on it and when you want to remove it, you just pull some straps that hang down to pull the clamps down.I have my TV placed high for this application with it tilting down so it's impossible to access the screws.  It won't be as big of an issue if it isn't tilted down, but i would see it being pretty difficult to do unless you have a really long screwdriver.",0,Negative
"great product, very sturdy, easy to put up, and good price. i got this mount for my 42 inch LCD T.V and it looks great on the wall. i was little nervous about it at first because i thought since it was cheap it was no good but looks can be deceiving. the only bad thing about it is that you have to take the t.v off the mount when you want to adjust it but hey who's going to adjust the t.v that often anyways???? so this is a 50/50 CON",4,Negative
"This is a nice compact kit.  It comes with screws to handle I would say every possible VESA compatible TV, and lag bolt for mounting to studs, and anchors for mounting into cement (i.e. basement install).  It even includes a small level.  I had already used a Cheetah arm mount before, and it was similar in including everything and being well built.Even though it is in the description, check your stud location prior to purchasing. The wall mount is about 27&#34; wide, so allows some play for mounting on studs, but not necessarily enough to let you mount anywhere.  I have a built in TV area where this was to be used, and there was a stud dead center since this is where the outlet was mounted.  This meant the other studs were about 16&#34; to the left and right.  As a result, I could not simply mount this in the center unless I wanted to use a single stud to support (which I did not).  So I purchased a 2x10 and cut to 38&#34; and used lag bolts to attach to the three studs, countersinking them, and then was able to mount the bracket.  You can't see the wood because the set completely covers, and it only brings the set out about 1.5&#34; further, which is fine.  Bit this turned a 1 hour project into 3.But still a 5 star product.  Had I check fist, I would have looked for a product with a 36-38&#34; bracket, which would have spanned the two outer studs.",2,Negative

The mount itself works. not to difficult to install. holds well and has plenty adjustment to make it work.

"I purchased this mount for my new Samsung un55f7500 based off of the 4.5 star rating and over 4000 reviews.  Upon receiving the mount everything looked great.  Once I started to put it together though, I began to regret my purchase.  The vertical braces for the mount are held together with small screws.  One of the screw holes for my mount was drilled too small for the provided hardware and would not hold the braces tight... Still jiggled.  This gave me an uneasy feeling with it not being solidly held together, so I ran to home depot and got some 3/8 length 10 32 bolts and a couple nylon locking nuts and used those on the 4 corners to hold the braces together instead.  Once the mount was assembled, I went to put it on the wall.  Got everything lined up and level and started to torque down the lag bolts into the studs.  I didn't even torque one of the bolts down fully and it ended up shearing off leaving me with just the bolt head falling out into my hands.  Another trip to home depot and I had 4 galvanized lag bolts, some remeasuring and leveling later I got the mount bolted to the wall.  One of the braces that attached to the back of the TV was stuck in the no tilt position.  I donty plan on tilting my TV, so this wasn't a big deal.  When it came time to screw in the safeties, only one of the holes was drilled properly.  Couldn't get the other safety to screw in, so my TV only has 1.Overall I'm happy with some parts of the product, but pretty disappointed with some of the installation issues I had",0,Negative

"The part of the mount that is secured to the wall comes in six pieces that you must bolt together with itty bitty nuts and bolts.

Overall, the TV mount is not nearly as impressive as the larger one I purchased and reviewed several years ago (Samsung Compatible TV mount by Valuemax).  However, there is plenty of strength here to hang my 32 inch LCD TV.My biggest frustration is that my cable outlet and electrical outlet are flush to the wall and positioned directly behind the mounted TV.  And there is not enough room between the mounted TV and the outlets to plug in the cable and power cord.  I think I will be able to solve this problem with right angle connectors. . .",0,Negative

The bracket was too small, even though it is supposed to be for up to a 65"" set.Luckily I was able to drill out the last hole on the bracket enough that I could get the bolt through to secure it to the set.  It still required physical modification and I was lucky the difference was small enough to correct.Lesson learned:  do not trust the sizing; verify first.",0,Negative

"This product works great.  The instructions could have been written a little more clearly, but what you need to do is pretty obvious.  It took me about an hour to put up my mount, but that was because my drill died and I had to let it charge a little while before continuing.  Also, if you have a cheaper drill, you may need to finish off the stud bolts with a ratchet.  I have a Black & Decker 20V Max Lithium Ion drill and it was only able to get them about halfway in, then it was the ratchet and 1/2 inch socket, but they went in pretty easy.  I am knocking a star off because for the bottom bracket there is a screw on each side you have to screw in AFTER the TV is mounted and that was a pain in the butt.  Other than that, it was a smooth install and my TV now hangs 65"" above the floor.I want to address some of the negative reviews that say this comes with extra pieces or that washers are the wrong size, etc.  Different TV's use different bolt sizes for the mount options.  So Cheetah includes multiple sizes (4).  So you have 4 sets of screws (16 total) to put the brackets on your TV and 4 sets of washers (16 total) and 4 sets of spacers (16 total).  So yeah, the manual only pictures 4 screws and you have 16, but you only NEED 4, not all 16.

This is the first time I used wall mount and was not sure what to buy. I needed to hang two TVs Sharp 60&#34; LED and Vizio 42&#34; LED. So I bought this mount and &#34;ATC Universal Tilt Wall Mount Bracket&#34; based on high ratings. I found this mount bigger but little weaker than Cheetah. As such both can hold the weight of any modern TVs upto 60~65&#34; weight upto 100lbs(keeping margin of 40~50lbs). The installation was quick and easy you will need a stud finder a drill/driver and wrenches. Stud finding was the only difficult part apart from that every thing was smooth.

"I'm not a big fan of this mount.The back plate comes in multiple pieces that needs to be put together before it can be used.Since the back plate is not a solid chunk of steel (like every other mount I've owned) its not as stable on the wall, and because it will flex your TV will not stay mounted flush or level.I would recommending looking else where.

Also the directions were terrible they recommend using a large drill bit for the 8mm lag bolt, if I would have followed their directions my tv would have been on the ground. The fact the you have assemble the thing is a bit annoying, I mean you really have to put this thing together. You get what you pay for I guess. Also the screws that are use to secure the thing to the bracket are a pain, you better have a long screw driver if you are mounting a large TV and patience because you will be trying to screw those in without any visibility.",0,Negative

"Before you start this little scary project, scary because if you do it wrong say bye bye thousand bucks !  Rest assured that if done right and mounted on studs, this mount will hold your expensive TV. Before anything else go to Lowes or Home Depot and buy the following 1. A very long philips screwdriver, trust me you need the longest one. 2. 1/4 size washers ( contractor pack ). 3. A reliable stud finder.I mounted a 55 inch Samsung LED TV , the problems I encountered were - the bracket that goes behind the TV did not sit flush, either the screws that came with the mount were too long or I am missing some washers. Regardless I fixed it by putting 3 1/4 washers at the bottom of the bracket and 2 up top, now the bracket is not loose and sits flush on my TV.

"I held off on buying a wall mount for my television because was in front of a window and also because I thought that they were really expensive. Couple that with my incompetence with mounting something on the wall and keeping it level, and you have a recipe for failure.So how did it turn out? I reorganized my living room to put the TV/entertainment system in front of a wall. I decided to save up for mounting kit, and was shocked when my search found this one. $25 shipped? Seriously? New? It's not broken or missing pieces? I hit 'buy' right away. No saving up required.The mounting process took some time. All of the measuring, marking the way, using the included level to make the holes even(I failed at this), finding wall studs, etc took me a while.  Unfortunately, the wall studs in my wall weren't spaced out optimally for the holes in the wall bracket. I made compromises and figured that it would hold my TV ok.Getting then mounting brace on my television took some work. Again the wholes didn't line up perfectly, so I made compromises on how high I wanted to the TV. Don't get me wrong, this item gives you a lot of flexibility, it's just with so many different mounting environments that it has to work with, it can't be perfect for all of them.ProsThe product is well made and not flimsy in any way. They give you good instructions and different thicknesses of screws and even tell you what drill bit size to use.Cons:The large level that this unit comes with seems to be off a bit. I used to for this product and for a couple of posters that I mounted yesterday and what it said was level definitely wasn't. I recommend using your own level or measure and remeasure the height of the holes to make sure that they are the some.Since I'm so bad at making items level, I'm going to look for an attachment for my television that let's you correct the level of the screen after you mount the wall brackets. Why? It's guaranteed that I am going to mount it unevenly, and I don't want to make my wall look like someone sprayed it with a machine gun from all of my attempts to get the leveling part right.",2,Negative
Compare to best buy.....lolThis is way better!nothing else to say but need more words to submit. that's dumb,4,Negative
"This is a difficult one to rate, as the bracket itself is sturdy enough, but the gold HDMI cable ends broke off trying to plug into the TV.",0,Negative
"This does its job, although it is a bit difficult to install the second set of screws that anchor the TV onto the wall mount. It's strange how the TV actually sits on the wall bracket (which enables you to easily remove the TV from the bracket, if necessary. Overall, it still does it's job and has held up in our walls (mounted on dry wall using no less than 10 dry-wall anchors for safety) for over a month now.",0,Negative
"Good mount, sturdy and easy to install. Comes well packed in a compact package, disassembled so some assembly is required. The set also comes with a variety of metric bolts and spacers for attaching the brackets/hooks the TV and lag screws for mount frame to the stud. Some cons: the M8x25 bolts provided were too long for my 50 inch Samsung so a trip to Lowe's for some M8x16s was needed. The locking screws on the lower part of the bracket which secures the TV to the mount is hard to reach so I had to leave them unsecured for now.",0,Negative
"Here are the reasons:1) The wall frame comes in 6 pieces. I don't mind assembling things, but the manual is horrible. Has a few pictures in one side and a lot of text on the other side that doesn't really help much. The pictures are not detailed enough.2) The pictures were for some other model (step 2), the two horizontal bars have 2 screws that were supposed to use the same tool, but  you need to use different tools.3) The vertical bars used to connect the two horizontal bars came defective. Both have have two screw holes, but one of them on both do not allow the screw to pass. They probably knew about the problem because the screw is completely screwed on one side, but not on the other side. Clearly showing the manufacture could not screw and sold the product anyway.I don't understand why they put this poor quality HDMI cable in the box. They should spend some more money on the tv mount itself instead of adding more crap to the package.Already requested to return and get a refund. I will never get close to products from Cheetah again!",0,Negative
"a cant miss... if ppl say this is hard to put up it is simply because they are not smart enough or skilled enough to do it. they should be hiring a professional. i just call it how i see it. this mount took about 1 hour from start to finish to install. the directions could be printed a little larger, otherwise a spectacular product.",4,Negative
"Great mount it had loads of extra pieces which you will not need if you're using your house's wall studs as you should. It can hold up tp 165 pounds meaning it can hold up a TV of up to 165/4= 41.25 pounds in weight. My TV was a 42"" and 32.5 pounds and I'm using a tilt of 15, which does put added pressure on the top part of the mount, all will be fine. You are always best of using your wooden studs in wall with the included 3/16"" bolt screw. The leverage this gave the tv was more then I dreamed of, specially having used a couple of other mounts before. Now if you want added support use a slightly smaller wood drill bit and drill your 2"" hole, this allows the bolt screw to latch onto even more wood and is better then the one they recommend(3/16"" drill bit). I used a size 5/32"" bit. All that aside this took me roughly an hour to construct purely because I was single handed and lacking some of the tools to put this together(My Philip screwdriver seemed to object my use and hid from me, for over 15 minutes).Now I had read some negative reviews and know they are mostly of human construct. The cheetah mount brought more then enough items for use in case of extraordinary measures. It brings 3 different standard sized TV back screws for the TV and enough locks. All the pieces where simple to assemble and I did not need to look at the manual. I have never mounted a wall mount on my own need I mention. This Mount seemed more then adequate and the best part was the leveling, it was quite easy to do and was made even easier by cheetah's inclusion of one.THIS IS A NOTE FOR THOSE WORRIED ABOUT EXTRA UNMARKED PIECES:""Keep it simple stupid"" comes to mind, this is a simple project and all those extra pieces if you don't know what they do, don't worry. They are only for extraordinary circumstances.The only Con i noticed was the manual on this was sub par. The pictures where far and hard to make out as well as the instructions where generic and not very helpful. I simply ended up looking at the picture on the box and going from there. How hard can it really be? its a frame attached to your wall with another frame hooking onto it at 15? This mean human ingenuity is most certainly welcomed but not required at all. If you're having a hard time stop being stubborn and ask someone else, if you cant figure it out. Don't have anyone else? Use youtube!On the Amazon forums you can find quick guidelines on how to spot knockoffs. Usually the number one sign is a generic white box for a non generic item. others would be sub-par quality and bad or no customer service. However that is why Amazon allows you to report this and even gives you a refund on most purchases.",2,Negative
"I have done a bunch of mounts for TV's, and this is not a good design when the actual mount has to be assembled, it leaves a lot of error to happen when mounting, screws could come loose and it makes both sides of the mount uneven. The clearance from wall to TV is not enough room to use the tilt feature when your cable connections are flush with the back of the TV. It was cheap and it is getting the job done, with my experience it doesn't look terrible, but for a newbie I would spend the extra dough and get a solid mount.",2,Negative
"I was having sticker shock from the overpriced versions of this ingeniously simple TV wall mount offered by the 'bricks and mortar' video stores.Enter the Cheetah Mount. Does everything the other mounts do, without the 'disco' hype and ridiculous prices.It's strong, simple to assemble, reasonably priced, and it GETS THE JOB DONE.Why pay through the nose for a piece of black metal that is forever hidden behind your TV?SOLD !!!",0,Negative
I used to hang up my 55 inch Panasonic Viera. The plasma is about 68 pounds and the mount has no problem holding it up.,0,Negative
"I purchased this wall mount to use with a Sony KDL60R550 LCD TV.  Everything went together fine, but when I put the TV on the wall I could not lock in the bottom of the bracket becuase the bottom of the TV was touching the wall.  This is a very slim (flush) wall mount and unfortunately the Sony is the thickest at the bottom and not where the brackets attach to the back of the set.  So I am left with an openend package for this bracket that I cannot use and had to order a bracket with more clearance.  I don't blame the bracket other than there were no indicators that this may be a problem on this model of Sony TV (which is why the 4 starts and not 5).  So check out the TV you will be mounting to and make sure the thickest part of the TV is not more than an inch deeper than where the mounts attach.",2,Negative
"The mount seems great, but the instructions are just horrible!!!!Still haven't completed it yet cause it was just that annoying!!! I will never buy another cheetah product again!",4,Negative
I was scary to order it but once i got it........ its everything I needed and it got it done,4,Negative
"I have 2 of these now, one holding up a 55"" LED and one holding a heavier 42"" LCD.  Both are holding steady and not budging.  I didn't bother with the security screws for either; they would have been too difficult to install.  No reason to get anything fancier or more expensive.",0,Negative
"This bracket does the job. Really the only problem that I have with it is that it is extremly difficult to hang the tv due to the fact that you have about 1/2 inch of clearance on the back of the tv. There are screws that have to be tightened to hold the tv on, so you either need a really long screwdriver or extremely skinny arms. (Or you could always duct tape a normal screwdriver onto a rod and tighten them that way...which was what I did.)",0,Negative
"Cant beat the price.  Holds up my 60&#34; plasma tv that weighs 60lbs.  Was easy to install.  Use your own level instead of the crappy one it comes with.  Comes with hardware to mount in studs, brick and other types of wall.",4,Negative
"This is a relatively cheap mount that gets extremely close to the wall, looks great when installed. It is nearly impossible to plug anything in to the bottom of a TV once it has been mounted without lifting it out of the mount. This isn't much of an issue when using a receiver, but it is slightly annoying if you need to just quickly plug something in to the TV. It tilts downward a bit if needed.",2,Negative
did exactly what i needed it to do. came with an HDMI cable. holds my old 47&#34; tv that weighs about 80 lbs with no drama.,4,Negative
"The bracket was simply made, simply assembled and mounted on the wall easily.It came with more than enough optional screws and bolts to mount it to the TV and the wall. It's rare that I don't go to my garage to grab extra hardware (screws, bolts, wahers ...).This kit was complete with exrtras for my parts bin!!!!",0,Negative
"This mount works really well for what it does. It comes with extra screws, and even an HDMI cable. While it's not hard to put together, the instructions are a bit slim. Checking the pictures and examining the parts for labels (like ""UP"") that aren't mentioned in the instructions is required to get it together. Barring that, it went together - and onto the TV - easily enough.It does mount close to the wall, which can make getting cables plugged in difficult, especially if you get the final ""safety"" screws in place. This seems to be an issue with all or most wall mounts, though. At least according to the reviews of other mounts, no matter how expensive.As others have noted, getting the safety screws in place is a major pain. I finally gave up on the second one - my TV isn't moving without more effort than I'm willing to give it.I'm amazed that a mount at this price point works at all, much less as well as this one does. I can put up with minor flaws that make setup a little more difficult for the savings. If I couldn't, I'd have paid someone else to install one for me.",0,Negative
"UPDATE 7/7/14: I raised my rating to 3 stars because the company rep contacted me via the comments and I appreciated that followthrough by them. Unfortunately, I am writing this a couple months after the purchase. After we returned this mount, we bought a more expensive and substantial mount at Lowe's and had no problem installing it.ORIGINAL REVIEW 7/4/14: We had to send it back. My husband could not get it to install properly and it was missing a key part. Very confusing instructions.",3,Negative
The mount works. I wanted a mount that held the TV close to the wall but I ran into issues with my Panasonic plasma. This mount sits so tightly against the wall that I had to purchase 90 degree adapters for my coax and HDMI cables or they would kink against the wall. I guess I could have screwed a 2x4 to the wall first and then used this mount but that would have been ugly. In hindsight I probably would have chosen a different type of mount but I made it work.,2,Negative
Perhaps my expectations were high based on some prior purchases. My dissatisfaction stems from the fact that the bracket that attaches to the wall is not one complete piece. It is in fact 4 pieces that has to be assembled. The previous bracket I purchased was one piece. Therefore there was less assembly. Also make sure you read the sparse instructions. There are different size screws for the top and bottom bracket. Why not just one size screw? Does the top need stronger screws? this did not make any sense to me. Also why print the instructions in such tiny print?All in all I got it mounted and it works..,0,Negative
"I was surprised at how sturdy this wall mount is.  It's very low priced compared to other wall mounts I've bought.  It mounts the TV very close to the wall (which I like).  The only problem with it being so close to the wall is that it's hard to access inputs on the back of the TV.  It's possible to access the inputs, it's just a little difficult.  I would recommend plugging things in before you lift the TV up onto the mount.  I definitely have no regrets getting this mount.  I also liked the fact that it came with a level and an HDMI cable.  That was an added plus.",0,Negative
"Mounted a 65 inch Panasonic TV with this holder. The main problem with this mount is that the arms are too weak and they sag. This means even if the mount is level when you install it, once you put the TV on, it will sag a bit.This means the TV will not be perfectly level and you will want to tilt the tv up. However, this is not possible since this only has a DOWNWARD adjustable tilt.The mount does not feel solid for the larger TV. I am thinking this is the edge of their spec and that a smaller/ lighter tv would do better. Moving the arms in and out is not smooth.However, it is cheap and it does work. I just wish I paid more for a sturdier mount to go with my expensive TV.",0,Negative
"As many others,I was quite skeptical of the quality due to such a low price. The shipment arrived promptly with all the listed parts in the box. The frame requires only 4 screws to assemble and is quite heavy gauge. The only criticism I have is that the frame mounting holes do not line up at 16"" on center,so I did have to drill holes to accomodate for that factor. Considering the savings of well over $100,I don`t think needing to drill a few holes in the frame to be a deal breaker. If you can hang a picture on the wall,then you can handle this as well,including drilling out a few extra holes in the frame yourself.The integrated level was off a bit as well,but I had expected that it would be off from all the duress from transport anyway,just use your own from home. Save a ton of money and buy this,it`s more than worth it,even considering the tweeks needed after the sale.",2,Negative
"The mount it self is just fine. It's a little bit of work to put together. You have to assemble the back bracket with some smaller screwes and nuts.My biggest challenge with this mount was the fact I have a 65&#34; TV. The mount is rated for up to a 65&#34; TV, which is true it technically fits, but gives you no wiggle room for adjustments. The back bracket barely fits where the mounts on the TV needs to go so if your studs do not line up perfectly then you can not adjust much. I ended up buying a second mount that was rated for a 70&#34; and that worked perfectly.",2,Negative
"This mount is very poorly built. The built in level arrived destroyed, yet packaging was intact so it looks like it came this way from the factory. The HDMI cable included was defective. I had to go and buy a replacement. The entire unit is built to really poor manufacturing standards. The side brackets don't fit squarely, you have to manually straighten the frame when you build it, and it is not square on the edges.",1,Negative
I purchased this and was totally shocked the product came in such a small box.  The entire back frame is in pieces actually 6 to be exact.  While those pieces do feel rigid they need to be bolted together.  Personally I do not like the idea of that.  There is nothing like one solid piece of steel.  This looks like an exercise in trying to save freight.  Had I known this was a jigsaw puzzle I would not have purchased this.,0,Negative
Had to purchase additional parts to compensate for size issues and washers that were not able to fit even with the enclosed instructions. Item not appropriate to hang a 32 inch flat-screen.,4,Negative
"This is a very sturdy wall mount that I just used for a 42"" TV. It adjusts vertically and also horizontally which some other wall mounts do not so if your studs in your wall leave your screws not quite where you need them, it slides either right or left.",2,Negative
"This mount seems fine, and is fine -- once you get the right-size mounting screws.Cheetah nicely includes a bag of bolts and screws for (presumably) every possible type of TV.BUT - not for my Sony 46EX500. You'd think Cheetah would know what a Sony TV needed.On the other hand, Sony goes through the trouble of including a warning about using incorrect screws, rather than trouble themselves to include them.In addition, the 4 screws that mount to the stand do not work in the wall-mount holes. Why not?Bottom line, I was at the Lowe's ""specialty screws"" section for a while before I found screws close enough to Sony's specs to use.Frankly, I was upset with both companies.",0,Negative
"I received it and was very concerned by the size an weight of the box. open it up and am even more concerned. start to put it together and realize why its so cheap. It is very basic as others have mentioned. It does however hold my 32"" TV without any issue whatsoever. I would say plan on mounting it to studs instead of using the sheetrock plastic wall inserts that comes with it. they will not tighten and I wouldnt hang my coat on it the way it was with those.My only REAL complain with it is how the tilt down works. you basically put shims in that come with the packing. Well they dont offer longer screws for more shims so the tilt feature it speaks of is very limited.Overall when I hang my other 32"" TV in my bedroom ill order another but I wouldnt trust it with my $2,000 52"" 3D TV.",0,Negative
I bought this originally to mount a 46&#34; and just recently I have purchased a 55&#34;. Holds both up with no problem. My only source of frustration was the instructions weren't explained in too much depth but I figured it out fairly quickly.Also if you're as impatient as I am I suggest you get yourself a stud-finder as I got irritated with the knocking/magnet method and just started drilling holes every 16&#34;. The TV hides all the holes though! Guess I gotta buy some spackle now...,0,Negative
Can't believe how good this mount is for the money.  Had a guy install my 52 inch Sony high up on the wall...he now will be ordering this mount.  A no brainer for the cost.,4,Negative
This mount has been great so far. I mounted my 50&#34; LED above my fireplace and it has held strong so far. Really easy to install. The only problem is that I dont have enough access behind my TV to screw the locking screws in. But it doesnt seem like it is going to come off even without those locked. Great mount.,0,Negative
"This mount is okay. I had trouble aligning the top two rods, the bottom rods aligned fine, so there is a quality issue for sure.I used this to mount my 42 inch. also once mounted there are two screws that needs to be screwed in the bottom, which seems to be very difficult as there is not enough room to get to it.",0,Negative
"My wall has 24&#34; center studs.  As a result, hanging my Vizio 60&#34; LED TV (approx 55lbs) causes the mount frame to sag - especially since I have to slide it to one side in order to center on the wall.  Check the construction of this frame compared to, say, The Mount-It! Low Profile frame and you will notice that this frame is only made with two thin frame bars while others consist of a more solid one-piece frame.  I wouldn't recommend this frame if you are mounting anything over 47&#34; or anything over 40lbs.",0,Negative
"It's made of fairly heavy-gauge steel, pretty strong. Installation is no easier or harder than any other wall mount. We've had an old-ish 55"" LCD (not an LED - so it's about 4"" thick, even 5"" at the base, and about 90lbs) hanging on this for almost 3 years, and so far, there have been no problems. I will add that we have some serious bass in the room, and that the kids stomp on the floor upstairs from this room all day every day (jumping off beds, chairs... dressers... what have you) so this is about as much abuse as you could imagine a wall mount experiencing, other than being placed on a boat or in a camper/RV. Solid buy.",3,Negative

"I have been using Cheetah mounts for several years now.  They used to be a 5 star product, but I'm re-reviewing this product and lowering it to 1 star after they have made several changes to the product in an obvious attempt to cut manufacturing and shipping costs.  After opening the package to hang my latest television, I discovered that the top and bottom rails are no longer 1 solid piece of steel.  They are now two pieces that need to be bolted together in the center by 12 screws, just so they can make the box smaller.  The steel itself is much thinner now and instead of a powder coat finish, they are using cheap spray paint.  There used to be a bubble level attached to the top bracket, in addition to a small torpedo level in the box.  The mounted bubble level is now gone, and the torpedo level has been replaced with a cheaper one too.  You used to be able to adjust the tilt of the mount using thumb levers.  Those thumb levers are now gone, and have been replaced with philips screws, so now you need to try to hold a screwdriver in the 3"" gap between the wall and the television.  Believe it or not, they even cut back on the lag bolts used to secure the mount to the wall.  Now, instead of 4 large lag bolts, they now give you 2 large and 2 small.  I used to be able to assemble one of these in 5 minutes; this one took 30.What's worse is they replaced the original Cheetah mount with this piece of crap, so they could keep all the 5-star reviews they had received on the previous bracket!  What they should have done is listed it as a new product, as they have completely changed every aspect of the product and certainly the quality.  Very deceptive practice!  I will certainly never purchase another bracket by this manufacturer.  They should be ashamed of themselves.",0,Negative
"I used this when I moved an older TV to a new room. There is no issue with the bracked but my old TV is an LCD so it is thicker.  I think this bracked is made to accomodate a LED TV. Again, no issued at all with the bracket, my older TV is the problem but I got it to work.",3,Negative
"I had purchased one of these last year and this one was slightly I different. The rectangular piece that bolts on the TV came in four pieces and you had to assemble then install to he back of the TV. Would have rather had one solid piece instead. It mounted he TV fine, just not as positive review with this change. I bet they did. This as the box they ship in is smaller now.",0,Negative
We had to do some modification on this bracket for the LED TVs are so low profile that the power cord on the 55&#34; Samsung was in the way. Just had to notch the bracket to make it fight correctly.,0,Negative
"I bought this for my new 65"" plamsa.  It's a solid mount, and the second I've bought from Cheetah Mounts.  The problem is that the mounting bracket that you attach to the wall is only 1/2"" wider than the mounts on the TV (24"" vs. 23.5"").  This means that I would need to have the studs perfectly centered in the space I'm looking to mount the TV.  But my studs are off, so even mounting the bracket on its edge wasn't enough, I was still short 2"".  I could have drilled holes in the mount and made it work, but I had a bad feeling about doing this.Instead I had to return this mount and I bought one from Monoprice that is 45"" wide.  Amazon doesn't sell a comparable product.If you are considering this mount, I recommend researching the width of the VESA holes on your TV and see how much slack you have on the 24"" bracket.  If it's going to be close, and your studs aren't perfect, consider getting a wider mount.",2,Negative
The price is right for this mount!! It has done well to hold my TV on to the wall with no issues. I'll by another one when the need arises.,2,Negative
"PROs+ Sturdy steel construction+ Ability to tilt TV+ Can accommodate almost any bracket holes, even non-standard ones (like my discontinued Olevia 232)CONs- Pre-drilled holes don't match to the standard 16"" stud distance (even the manual states that most homes have studs every 16 inches).  I had to use the pre-drilled holes on the left side, then the ""wide"" holes for the right side.- The included ""spacers"" are as long as the screws themselves, so they're worthless.- You have to adjust the tilt before you hang your TV.  First, how are you supposed to know how much to tilt it before you hang it?  Second, how are you supposed to make sure the tilt on the left side matches the tilt on the right side, unless you hang it?  You can't reach the tilt controls after it is hung, so it is a frustrating process of putting the TV on the wall, then off the wall to adjust, then on the wall again until you get the tilt right.- One of my tilt knobs were broken, so I had to secure it with a standard screw and nut.",2,Negative
Works and it was a decent deal.  It comes with HDMI cable and leveler.  The unit works and I have no issues with it.,4,Negative
"This thing takes about 10 minutes to setup and have mounted on the wall. When I first took it out of the package, I was a little skeptical of the quality. But after I mounted it to the wall and did a few pull ups on it I was sold. This thing isn't going anywhere. We hung three TV's in the house and it worked with all of them (2 LG and Sharp). I had to run out and buy toggle bolts for over the fireplace because the stud spacing was too far, but other then that I didn't need to buy any extra pieces. I did not expect toggle bolts would come with this. For the price, you cannot beat this. We got three for the price of the ONE we saw locally.",4,Negative

This is my third wall mount for three different sized T.V.'s. The second one is not a Cheetah brand and is not made as well.

And they are less than half price than the flimsy ones at the big box stores! Cheetahs from now on!,0,Negative
"held up my 42&#34; LG TV no problem, it swivels slightly and even came with an HDMI cable and level for installation. the only other thing you need to get this installed is a stud finder and a ratcheting wrench.

"My boyfriend bought this mount for his new Samsung 51"" plasma. Because the overall review score for this product is very high, he didn't really read the negative reviews. BIG MISTAKE. This mount is advertised as a tilt mount that will angle your tv up to 15 degrees. However, we have found that this mount is actually a giant piece of crap that not only DOES NOT TILT your tv, but also BREAKS YOUR CORDS AND INPUTS ON YOUR TV. That's right; this mount broke our brand spankin' new Samsung. This is why:* This mount does not move your tv away from the wall enough to allow room for cords such as the power cord, HDMI, coaxial, AV, composite, etc. So unless you are planning on not plugging your tv into anything and just staring at a black screen all the time, this will be a problem for you.* Because there is not enough room for your cords, they are crushed between the tv and the wall which is not only bad for the cord, but can apparently also break your tv. The stress caused by the audio cable being pressed into the input completely broke the casing around the optical audio port. The cord can't even be plugged in now, it just falls back out. So now we'll have to pay to get our brand new tv fixed.* This mount also does not reach a 15 degree tilt, even with no cords attached to the tv! How incredibly stupid is that?!  The reason is that the ledge on the bottom of the part that mounts to the wall simply does not match up with the bottom ledge on the part that attached to your tv anywhere between about a 5 to 15 degree tilt. So while the top part is set at an angle, the bottom is being pushed out, thus cancelling out most of the angling you're getting on the top. The result is a tv that may as well be mounted flat to the wall - you can only hope to get a tilt of 5 degrees or less, which is basically nothing.I am shocked that this product gets any good reviews. The mount is flimsy, the tilt doesn't work, and there is a good chance that using this mount will break your cords, tv, or both. This is the third tv my boyfriend and I have mounted and It's the only time we've had any problems. We both own quite a bit of tech and tech accessories and we're both surprised this thing is even being made; it is literally the worst tech accessory we have ever purchased. My only guess is that a lot of people buying this mount didn't need the tilt and have not yet realized that their cords are being squished between the tv and the wall. That will be a nasty shock when they start having problems with their tv...or when they take the tv off the mount and all their cords just fall out. If you're already purchased this mount, I would encourage you to check your tv and cords for damage. Again, DO NOT BUY THIS MOUNT unless you're going for the `un-tilted broken tv' look.",0,Negative
If you mount your television on it properly it will be hard for anyone to steal it from you easily off your wall. I will buy a couple more for the rest of my flat screens.,2,Negative
"I was skeptical that a mount this small could hold up a 60&#34; TV but I was wrong. All the new LED tvs weigh very little in comparison to 5 years ago. I think my 60&#34; weighed only about 50 pounds. Theoretically I think it would hold my 5 year old LCD which weighs like 150 pounds, but I'm not going to try it.The included leveler seems a bit sketchy and wrong and I did not trust it.

"This is an extremely heavy duty mount that would be great for a large TV. Unfortunately, for my little 32&#34; in the bedroom, you can see the mount hanging out from both sides. Definitely overkill for a small TV. FYI, the mount is 29&#34; wide.

Purchased two of these mounts to hang two 51&#34; Samsung TV's. All the pieces and hardware were easy to identify and organize. Easy to mount the brackets to the TV. No problem mounting hardware to the wall. Easily handled the weight of the TV's with no problem.,4,Negative

Not a good bracket for mounting TV's on the wall.  Comes in multiple pieces that requires significant assembly.  The bracket is so low profiled to the wall that the HDMI connector rubs against the wall.  Now I've to buy special connector(s) to prevent damaging the HDMI cable!  I've seen better Cheetah products :(,1,Negative
it was easy to mount and instructions and tools were great but once mounted forget about being able to change cables or anything and that was horrible for me since one of my cables went out,0,Negative
This is junk. It's made from cheap thin metal and when you get it put together you can hardly reach behind it to set the screws so your t.v. doesn't fall off it.,0,Negative
"As others have noted, the 5 star reviews written on AMZ were for a prior revision of this product - not the one shown here.  The current product for sale is junk.  Cheetah advertises this new unit as &#34;improved&#34; and &#34;using less metal&#34;.  Read that as &#34;cost-cutting&#34; that doomed one of the best cost-quality ratio TV mounts.The new unit flimsy, uneven, and the included hardware is so bad the nuts will strip the screws on a medium torque setting.  Beware, they even cut costs with the lag screws.I fell for the &#34;overall 4-5 star&#34; rating game here on Amazon.  Cheetah is advertising the current (terrible) revision with the older (quality) units' ratings.  I came back and checked the review dates & now I see what they did.  Caveat emptor.",0,Negative
This Bracket is WAY BELOW the standard of previous purchase from Cheetah. Worse was after mounting the bracket and adjusting the angle the hooks will not fit with 15 degree angle; it interferes at the lower bracket. So it really does not do what it should. Disappointed and would return it but for all the work already expended.,0,Negative

"This is my first mount, so maybe I'm being overly critical.  I gave this 3-stars because everything worked out fine on the end and I spent far less money than I would have spent on other options, but I do have some complaints.First, the top bar, the one the TV sits on, appeared visibly warped.  When I placed my own 4' level on the bar, you could see that it bowed up in the middle.  When I finally hung my TV, it was level, but I think I just got lucky, actually.Second, the tilt function can't be adjusted once the TV is up.  Okay, I knew that going in.  But the tilt mechanism could use some kind of marking so that you can tilt both sides evenly.  I hung my TV, not an easy task, got everything all hooked up and then realized the left side was tilted further than the right, which gives the impression the TV itself isn't level (it is).Third, and I'm not sure this is really a valid criticism, but more of a ""heads up"" to all of you out there...there really is very little to no room behind the TV after the TV is hooked up to connect wires.  So, I hung my TV up, realized I had a problem (yes, I have terrible foresight), then had to take the TV down again and get the wires to the general area of the connection (wire-tied them to the frame itself so they would hang out right where I needed to connect them).  THEN, I rehung the TV...and realized then that I couldn't SEE the connections.  So, instead of taking it down again, I got a picture of the back of my TV from google, so I could sort of figure out which of my wires needed to be connected where.So, in the end, the product served its function (but the levelness could have been a mini-disaster if not for what I attribute to blind luck), but not without the headache of rehanging the TV a couple times.  Yes, some of that was my own lack of foresight, but the product did not have super ease of use either.",0,Negative
"the mount is perfect, my samsung 60&#34; led tv sits on it nicely, only problem is the screws that comes with the package, they are not strong enough to hold the weight if you have drywall, i went to home depot and got those fastener with anchor, then problem solved.",2,Negative
"PROS-  It has a solid, well built, frame.  Sturdy powder coated metal that looks and feels of a better quality than the price makes you expect.-  Mounted right:  There will be no fear that your TV will tumble.-  The priceCONS-  The bolts/screws appear to be provided somewhat at random.  Mine was missing washers and the parts bag was actually ripped open before I opened the box.  I had suitable replacements in the garage, or they could probably be purchased for $1 at a local hardware store...not a big deal, but it could be a nuisance.-  Instructions are comically bad.  Not a big issue, because you really shouldn't need them.CONCLUSIONAt a discounted price - this is a good deal.",4,Negative
"The directions aren't very explicit, but it's not too hard to figure out what you're doing.  I opened the box to find the mount in four pieces.  You connect the sides to the tops to make a square.  Find two studs in the wall, drill holes. Screw the brace in place with the supplied screws.  Screw the brackets onto the TV.

"I couldn't believe what Walmart was charging for a stand like this. It's sturdy and slim; holding up mt tv well on my concrete walls. What a deal!  Had it assembeled within minutes. It only has 4 pieces. Not sure why people on here complained about it taking a while to do so. The only issue I had was that the HDMI cable tip broke off when I pulled it off my cable box the very first time (it's long, about 8 or 9 feet). Too bad because it looked like a nice quality cable, with reinforced webbing casing the cable itself. No a huge problem since I had a cable already, that one was just a bonus.",1,Negative
"I was able to mount my 32"" Samsung LED TV to my wall with this product after much frustration. Included with this purchase was one of the worst assembly instructions I have ever seen. It came with a lot of screws but it is up to you to figure out which one to use. When I managed to figure out where everything went, actually mounting the TV was not difficult. Once the tv is mounted properly, it was held firmly in place. I tried to shake it loose but the tv would not budge. Lastly, I recommend plugging in your cables before you place the tv on the mount. The space between the wall and the mounted tv is too narrow.",2,Negative
"This went up easy and it was very simple to mount my TV, however, once it is mounted it is a little hard to adjust, you need a very long screw driver or you need to remove the TV and that can be a pain.",0,Negative

This  item is not the best for trying to mount a 32&#34; to 50&#34; inch TV. It is very light weight and appeared to not be of the best quality. I dod not use it. I will keep it in the event we purchase a small TV smaller than 32&#34;.,4,Negative
"This works well.  Easy to install.  It comes with a variety of screw lengths to mount to your TV.  The HDMI cable seems to be of high quality and is no extra charge.  The level is handy ( I will use it for other projects around the house) but I would suggest a laser level when mounting on a wall.  I was able to install this by myself with a laser level.  If you use the level provided you will need two people or you may likely be putting many holes in the wall to get it level.The only negative I have deals with the retention screws to hold the TV in place.  They are very long and a bit of a pain to get to with a screw driver.  I have installed other wall mounts with similar designs but shorter screws that hold the mounts in place just as well.  I did not find this small negative enough to take a star off.With the HDMI cable and nice little level, this is a good deal on a wall mount.",0,Negative
"I installed the wall bracket early this week. It does the job but IMHO not be the best choice for your slim HDTV. The design leaves almost no room between the TV and the wall after mounting your TV onto the wall bracket. This creates a few problems:1) you will have to adjust tilt before you mount your TV2) makes it almost impossible to tighten the security screws, which are important to keep the TV in place3) you will not be able (or extremely difficult) to get access to any inputs/outputs at the back of the TV",0,Negative
"I returned it. It is a good concept, but it did not work well. It felt cheap and flimsy. I bought another mount for about half as much money which was much more solidly built.",4,Negative
"Bought this nearly a year ago, my bad for not taking it out of the box and using it right away.  There are two positions for the TV bracket on this mount.  As shipped it is in the &#34;upper&#34; position to hold smaller monitors.  I needed to move it to the lower position (which is how the product picture shows it) for a 21&#34; monitor.  The screws were so tight that it took considerable effort to break the first one loose, the second one never did come out, ended up stripping the screw head.  Even an EZ Out with a vice grip would not budge it.  Now it's in the trash...",0,Negative
"I bought this to install a 13"" TV under the standard upper cabinets in my kitchen. There were no real instructions or a real template, but I slogged on. As mentioned in other reviews, the screws did not fit the cabinet - I went out and bought 12x3/4"", which were just right.However, even though I had measured and followed all instructions in the product description on Amazon, the mount cannot be used as described. The TV is small - only 10"" top to bottom (I sawed off the built-in stand), and weighs less than two pounds. Unfortunately, the mount covers some of the inputs below the mounting holes, so I had to raise the position of the mount. With this adjustment, in order to fold the TV back under the cabinet, the mount would have stuck out about two inches in front of the cabinet, and two of its mounting holes could not have been used, making it unstable and useless.I'm using it open, so that my TV (since it now has no stand) covers part of my counter top, until I replace it with something.I think the main problem is that in being designed as a ""universal"" bracket, but that one size fits all approach just doesn't work.",2,Negative

I purchased this with a Samsung 22 inch led tv for under cabinet. This tv has higher VESA mounts and you would need a 20 inch deep cabinet to mount it.

There is no drooping that we have observed.  You can lock the tilt of the screen down once you make it level and it won't move.  Very happy with the product and price.",3,Negative
"Who would buy just ONE speaker mount? This is stupid. I was expecting there to be a PAIR of mounts in the package, but instead it is ONE mount, so you need to buy TWO of these things. I have no idea how they work yet, since I'm on here buying a second one now. LAME!",2,Negative
I bought these and mounted my 10lb speakers to them and no matter how tight I made them they always would sag? That ball is made out of hard plastic so there is no way for it to be held in place.

"Kind of implied in the sparse installation instructions, but the supplied nylon anchors are meant for solid wall (concrete, block, etc.) use.  Like others have noted they will not work in drywall - so don't try.  Good drywall anchors will work, but may decrease the capacity.  In my case, the monitor was centered on a wall stud, so was able to get a solid installation using 2 of the lag screws.  Mounting is close to the wall, so access to bolts for adjusting tilt is a pain, would work best when frequent adjustments are not required.",2,Negative

"I found that this mount worked well. I had no issues installing it.  I did note that some folk complained of the mounting bolts breaking. The manual calls for a 3/16ths drill bit. I held a bolt shaft up against a 3/16 drill bit and noted that the drill diameter was too small. Moving up a size to 13/64ths worked out well - while there was still more tightness than I liked when tightening up the bolts,I had no broken bolts. Perhaps even moving up another drill size would help.The manual is abysmal - it lists one step, and then the same thing in what, 47 languages. It was difficult to follow.  Having a separate section for each language would have been very helpful.",0,Negative
"Well, the cost was low, and I suppose you get what you pay for... it does the job of ""hanging a TV"" so that's an automatic 3 stars. It will not gain any more, however, due to the shoddy workmanship of the pull-tabs and hook attachment levers. Pulling down on one caused the entire rope assembly to snap off. Since it keeps the TV so close to the wall, it was very tough to get this assembly back on and rig it so it would not snap off again. The metal used to attach the rope assembly to the attachment mechanism is so thin a 2 year old could bend it. It would have likely been stronger if they just tied the rope to the assembly rather than attached it with a piece of metal so thin it could double as America's Next Top Anorexic. When I finally got the one back on and rigged it so it wouldn't snap again, I pulled the other one (much more lightly this time, I learned my lesson) and lo and behold, guess what happened... SNAP. I barely touched it!I like that it has a level built in, that was handy. The main set of mounting hardware is made of decently strong metal as well, and I am not afraid of the TV dropping from the wall, or anything... but if I need to remove the TV, I am going to have to be as skilled as a surgeon to not break the rigged system I have in place after both rope assemblies broke on me. I am not Iron Man, I know my own strength, I didn't pull on them very hard, and yet both broke. Not too pleased about that.",0,Negative
"Interesting how the description now says 22-37"". Yet when I bought it it was 22-42. WRONG. It was too short,but since I carried it to my house 540 miles away and I had it for over 30 days I was screwed. So I made it work,end of story. My moral of the story, open box and check ASAP.",0,Negative
"...but I'm not sure this is robust enough for larger TVs.  We have a 42"", 49 pound TV and that is probably its limit, though it claims it can hold up to 66 pounds.  Perhaps so, but the ""teeth"" that hold the brackets to the mounting plate are very small, around a 1/4"".  Why so tiny?  Not much variance for bumps or metal fatigue over time.",0,Negative
"This is a fairly heavy duty wall bracket which supposedly will hold a pretty big flat screen. The instructions are fine, but they do need a full parts list page as the supplied sheet is not particularly self explanatory that way. They do supply M5(mm) and up screws to fit most TV's but not the M4 for my 26"" Toshiba. Not a big deal - the local hardware store had them for about 30 cents each. I like the built in level but is kinda useless for my set up in an RV, but is handy for most others installing on a home wall. It is accurate though (I checked it after others complained that it wasn't).Well built unit - not fancy, but will do the job",0,Negative
"At first I was worried that I might end up returning it because people complained about the width with no overlap for placement on studs that might not be 16&#34; on center.After receiving it I found that, for my 42&#34; TV, I didn't need to have both sides secured with 2 bolts on each side. 2 bolts near the middle were more than sufficient to hold my TV securely to the one stud I found, which allowed me to center the TV on the wall. These are heavy duty bolts nearly 3 inches long. Follow the directions. Pre-drill the stud before screwing in the bolts. Like I said, they are heavy duty and too thick to try and drive in without pre-drilling.I have no worries of this mount ever failing, or the bolts coming out of the stud.The package comes with a variety of different screws for mounting the brackets to the back of a television. Choose the screws that match your TV and get a screwdriver. There were so many different sets of screws, I'm surprised that some reviewers didn't find what they needed.Though my TV worked perfectly with the cables coming from the side of my TV, I might understand why some that have cables which protrude straight out the back might be dissatisfied. This is a low profile mount and there won't be a lot of room behind the TV for cables that stick out the back toward the wall and would need allowance for a turn of the wire.Overall, it is solidly built. I found it easy to remove the TV and re-attach it (I did it out of curiosity after reading another review in which someone complained it wasn't easy). Maybe it's because of the size of my TV. If you have something larger you should probably have a second pair of hands.About the level: I didn't use it. If you don't own a good level, borrow one from a neighbor or family.",2,Negative

"Good: Solidly built; possibly a bit over-engineered in fact.  No flexing whatsoever with a 37"" monitor hung on it.  Good assortment of mounting hardware.  Bracket and tilt are a little difficult to secure once the TV is in place (there's only a few inches of clearance behind the set), but once you get the set screws tightened that TV will not move.  Very good price.Bad: Nothing significant.",0,Negative
"I've installed a lot of TVs.  From what I recall, I got the TV up, but the bracket was just so flimsy.  I would not recommend this to anyone or every buy it again.  I mean it did the trick but with so many other options out there I would buy something else.",4,Negative
"The price is way to high for what it offers, other universal products, for the same price you get lots of functions.  Is an abuse of Samsung electronics to obligate people with Samsung HDTV to buy this piece to adapt your HDTV to a better mounting arm.",1,Negative
We returned this item as it was no longer needed after we returned the TV that we bought it for.  The TV stand did not have enough tilt so that we could see it well and the bracket did not improve that situation as it had even less tilt than the TV stand.,3,Negative
"Difficult to install on some TVs and mine was an RCA.  It is also hard but not impossible to get level.  The problem is that there are several adjustments to get the TV where you want it and if they are not all 100% tight it will not be level.  This mount is kind of a pain to adjust to where you want it so I would say it works OK for an application where you want to set it and forget it.  If you want a swivel mount that you will move occasionally, keep looking.",0,Negative
"This bracket is amazingly sturdy and you have a lot of flexibility in how you want to locate your tv.  Many reviewers say the instructions are very poor. Well, they are even poorer when you don't receive them!  The seller emailed them less than 12 hours after I sent an email, but I had already installed it.  I have mounted a TV bracket by myself in the past.  Don't even think about with this one. It ain't happening.  When mounting the bracket to the wall and mounting the tv to the bracket, a third person would be helpful.The link for instructions is:  [...]",0,Negative

"While this product is solid I was sadly disappointed in what I received.  When the installer came, and he opened the box, he pointed out that one of the vertical arms was bent/damaged. There were also some scuff marks on the mount.  Two of the plastic molds, which hold the wires from the TV, were damaged (not usable).The installer was able to adjust the install, and straighten the arms to make the mount workable.Beware - when ordering - this item was not listed as refurbished, or damaged and it most certainly is.",2,Negative
"I bought this mount to place my 43"" Pioneer in my bedroom.  I chose this mount based on Amazon reviews because of the distance the arms extend and because of the heavy duty design of the arms.  After the installation is complete and I've spent some time using the mount I'm very happy with it.  I would buy one again and I would recommend this to a friend.  My eyes aren't young anymore and it's nice to bring the TV an extra 3 feet or so closer and then to be able to stow it back against the wall.  I give it 4 stars because I needed to modify it, the directions weren't very good, and the design could have been stronger in some places (tapped holes and provided hardware). On the plus side the arms are very sturdy and the linkage with the arms is nearly brilliant.Pros* Heavy duty arms* Multiple degrees of freedom* Very sturdy design overallCons* Some of the provided hardware isn't adequate* Requires modification of some of the parts for TVs in the smaller end of the size range* Arms can pinch cables* Tapped holes in sheet metal!Good to Know* Wall bracket is 26"" wide x 10"" high. Max width of bolt spacing with 5/16"" screws is about 24""* Outer mounting slots are 8 "" apart, top to bottom* Wall Arm Assembly weighs a little over 22 lbsSee the photos I posted to go with this review.There have been some comments about the adequacy of the directions.  They are one-sided photo copies and they were probably written by someone whose first language isn't English, but they get the job done.  The directions make a point that installation requires two people.  I had no problem installing the bracket and the TV by myself.  I had all four mounting holes in my wall drilled before I mounted the wall arm assembly and I had my wrench and the lag bolts handy, it really wasn't difficult.  Note that the wall arm assembly weighs a little over 22 pounds.  It can be a little tricky making the bracket on the TV align with the wall bracket when mounting.  For larger TVs it would be a very good idea to have two people to mount the TV itself, but one person can mount the wall bracket easily enough.  My TV weighs about 60 lbs.  I extended the wall bracket out from the wall, placed the TV on top of the dressers where I was mounting it, and then stacked books and Haynes manuals under the TV until it was at just the right height to install the screws between the TV bracket and the wall bracket.As the name implies this bracket is universal and I chose to make some modifications.  The adapter brackets that mount directly to the back of the TV are about 25"" long but my TV is only 24"" tall so the hacksaw came out.  It was really no problem to do, if you end up doing the same I recommend making your cuts so that the remaining mounting slots keep their full length plus as much edge distance as you can give them from the end of the slot to the cut you make.  I made my cuts at the end of the slot on the part being cut off.  I used a file and a black Sharpie marker to clean up the ends of the brackets after making the cuts.The adapter panel that attaches to the TV along with the adapter brackets has arms with 8 tapped holes spaced one inch apart for attachment to the adapter brackets.  My TV has 300mm x 500mm mounts and this left some length of the arms on the adapter panel proud of the brackets.  I chose to cut the arms down to just what I needed for a cleaner appearance.  I used the hacksaw for the straight cut, a Dremel tool to make the chamfers, and the file and Sharpie to finish up.  I think it looks much better without the extra material sticking out.  This joint with the tapped hole is a weak point in the design: a shear bolt into a tapped hole.  Because the screw exits into channel section there is plenty of room for a washer and nut on the back side of the joint.  This would be the repair if the tapped hole became stripped but I chose to get a longer screw and install the washer and nut initially.A lot of reviewers say something like it only took them two hours to install their bracket.  I spent about three times that just doing layout work to decide where the perfect place to drill my wall was.  Of course you must first find your studs but here is a very important consideration:  the TV is going to be in the center of the wall bracket when it is stowed all the way back.  It's not like fixed or tilting brackets where you can mount the wall bracket and then the TV will slide up to a foot left and right.  With this mount where you bolt the bracket up is exactly where the TV will center up.  To make this even more fun they designed this bracket so that with studs on 16"" centers you end up with one bolt at the end of a slot and on the other side a bolt in roughly the middle of a slot on the wall bracket.  This means you only benefit from about half of the length of the slot for adjustability.  For reference the slots are about 2 3/16"" long overall, with 5/16"" lag screws their effective length is about 1 7/8"".The lag screws that were provided for bolting the wall bracket to the wall were not adequate in my opinion.  They were 5/16"" x 3' lag screws as they should be, but the grip diameter of the bolts under the head was less that 5/16"" because of the cheap way they rolled the thread.  The bolt heads were flanged and no washers were provided. The flanged bolt heads were not large enough to grip both sides of the mounting slots on the bracket.  The bolt heads, though hex, even had a Phillips drive recess.  Who is going to drive a 3 inch bolt into a stud with a Phillips driver?  Garbage.Along with proper lag screws and washers, I bought some extra washers since some of the provided cut washers were thin and not manufactured cleanly and also of smallish outside diameter.  I should note that the bag of screws in 4, 5, 6, and 8 mm were all of good quality.  It was just the lag screws and some of the washers that were not.  When you are buying washers know that 5/16"" and 8mm are virtually the same size.  I upgraded the 8mm washers that mount the TV bracket to the wall bracket, but used the provided truss head bolts, they were really nice bolts for the job.With it all mounted up, I really like it.  I can pull my TV the advertised 32"" away from the wall.  If I extend it less than that I can use the capacity of the arm's travel to pan the TV left and right quite a good bit.  It can tilt all over the place.  The joints in the arms are quite stiff.  This doesn't bother me since my TV is only a 43"" and since it's older it's over 3 inches thick.  For someone with a newer, larger, thinner TV this would be an issue since they would be pushing on the glass essentially to manipulate the arms of the mount.  One could lubricate the joints or loosen the bolts but I'm going to see if the joints loosen up with use first.  I think I will want to move my panel with less effort ultimately though.The other issue is that this mount can seriously pinch your cables.  The pinch points I found are between the TV mounting plate and the outer arms on the wall arm assembly and between the wall mounting plate and the inner arms on the same assembly.  I found the cord covers to be pretty useless on inspection; I didn't even try them.  They don't look strong enough to manage stiff cords going through the motions.  My Pioneer has a system cable that runs into the panel, it's burly.  I used tie wraps.If you made it to the end of this review...well just wow, because it's really long.

"This mount was easy to install (Provided you have a stud finder.)The price is low and the function is just what I needed.One negative is that the mount kept tilting the monitor down to the ground no matter how tight I turned the knob.I got a pair of vice grips and tightened it up quite a bit, and it has not tilted since.That said, I wonder how long it will stay tight, and if it will strip if I have to re-tighten it up again.I would recommend this mount.",2,Negative

"I had a LCD monitor that did not have VESA compliant mounting holes and it also had the connectors directly where the bottom of the adapter goes. I was able to cut away part of the bottom of this adapter with an angle grinder and along with sanding down the plastic on the monitor and the metal indented square, I was able to use a combination of adhesives to glue this adapter to the monitor and then screwed the adapter to a swivel motion swing arm.Overall, it provided what I needed at a decent price.",2,Negative

I had to drill out the other holes, they were about 1/8 off. . so now, I have larger holes, trying to fit the bigger screws in the back, so I've had to add washers . . . and the whole thing looks like something made in 7th grade shop class.

"I just mounted a Sharp 55&#34; TV with 400x400 mounting holes. The Cheetah Mount did not come with the correct screws (I believe they were M8) and I ended up having to go to a hardware store to pick them up, which was kind of a pain.

I keep it closed, close to the wall, because I fear that if I fully extend it it will come off the wall.",2,Negative
"it holds my 27 inch tv to the wall with no problems, the articulating arm really helps in allowing you to squeeze it in to tight corners and get away with mounting it just about anywhere and if its in the way, just swing it against the wall and voila!

"I've unfortunately used other mounts before that cut off access to everything behind the tv and also that was so wide it mounted across to studs- thats as wide s the TV being mounted. Then the stars aligned and I found this baby. Mounts vertically on one stud, mounting bracket is approx 6 inched long so it disappears behind the tv. The articulating arms have adjustable tension settings and give full access to all cords and plugs all over the tv. The tv just floats really.Now the relly crazy part is that inside of the box (my box anyway) was a level to make sure the mount is square, a lens cloth to clean your screen, an hdmi to appreciate the cleanliness of your screen, and a key chain LED light! Also so mny spare screws that you are all but guaranteed to have you tv's mounting screws in the box. And nothing in the box seemed rinky dink, everything, including the level was all sturdy and well made. All that for $30!? This is the mount to buy,",0,Negative

Othe than that, it comes with absolutely everything you need including a really nice little level and a quality hdmi cable.  If I didn't have to cut the plate with my hacksaw (which was a bit of work) I would have rated 5 stars.  I don't know if I would use this for as big a TV as it says as the 1 stud in your wall that this would mount to would probably warp over time and mess up the structure of your house.",2,Negative

"Got this in 2 days, awesome! I used this mount to put up a 32"". Fairly straight forward install and was done in about 15 minutes. Included in the package are several different type of screws to accomodate a wide range of tv's.  A minor thing I encountered though is was I wasn't sure how to separate the bracket cover. I broke one of the clips in the process. All you have to do is pull it apart. No reason to spend $100 on a mount sold at your local stores. This is a solid mount.",2,Negative
"I needed this to install a TV in the bar I built in my basement. I didn't think about the stud situation until it arrived and has to mount this in the block wall. The anchors given with the unit are not great for this and had to get new from the hardware store. After installing it with the new anchors I mounted a 32"" Viera with no problems.

Hopefully, I can sell this on Craig's List.",0,Negative
This bracket is very versatile. You can adjust every aspect of the viewing angle and it takes up very little space. It comes with a selection of TV mounting screws so there should be a set to match your TVs&#8217; mounting holes. I mounted it to a wall stud using the heavy duty lag bolts that come with it. It&#8217;s going no where. It does have mounting hardware for drywall mount as well.I&#8217;m very happy with my decision to but this bracket.,2,Negative
"I bought this as it has so many reviews with a good rating and a great price, right? however I received one that didn't fit the 400x400mm VESA frame, it has manufacturing defects. Here's the detail:Installing the wall mount arm was pretty easy, you just need to drill two holes in the wall (you need a 3/8&#34; drill bit) and that's it. However, by the way, instructions are wrong as they say you should install the whole wall mount and then, attach the TV what is just really difficult (I tried it). So after not being able to do as instructions said I decided to unscrew the TV mount (the square that looks like an X in the picture) from the wall arm (it's only one screw that needs to be removed) to attach the TV and then put it back on the wall arm.Then that's how I found the problem... the square that has all the holes to set the extensions to fit the VESA frame for the TV has some manufacturing defects as it's not a square after all, one corner of the square is a little sorter than the others. In other words, the one I've received fits 3 of the 4 VESA frame on my TV, the last one is about 1&#34; far away.Other big problem is that the screws included are just crap, you need them to attach the extensions, but the screw gets worn (damaged thread). At least the ones I received got worn with a little torque, so I needed to buy some good screws (M6x16 I think).I'll update later how it went with the seller about this issue.",0,Negative

"Mounted a 32&#34; Westinghouse LCD tv that I'd say weighs around 30 pounds without the stand. The mount is flimsy with even half the weight it says it can hold. I tried tightening up the bolts, but then you can't bend or adjust the TV. As I have it now it's hard enough as it is to move and adjust.I also have a 46&#34; Mitsubishi TV that the manual says weighs about 60 pounds without the stand. I would never trust this mount with that TV.Bottom line: I wouldn't trust anything over 30 pounds with this mount.",0,Negative
"I am a big fan of Cheetah mounts as I have my other 60 inch mounted on one and its great.  But I will say this mount is poorly designed.  I know there is mixed reviews on here about it, and most are trying to say that this is user error or what have you.  But I have installed a number of wall mounts without issue.  The main problem I have found with this mount is the tilt.  They used a ball joint and three alan head screws connected to a plate to apply pressure to the ball joint, however if your TV is around 45-50 pounds this tilt feature fails and I was unable to get the ball joint tight enough to keep the tv tilted correctly!  I even ended up stripping the alan head screws!  So I went and bought different bolts and tightened them down as good as I could and I still had the same problem!  Cheetah mounts said this was a defect in the mount, but I don't think even if with a replacement that this issue would be resolved.  Poor design in my opinion.  Stay away from ball joints!  I would suggest adding some rubber to the ball joint, or change the design.  Also you may consider using torque heads instead of an alan head.  I am in the process of returning this for a different model and or brand.",0,Negative
"It does not support the weight of my 42&#34; TV very well without leaning or tilting, unless it is tightened enough to be difficult to move. Even with that, the arm doesn't seem strong enough for the weight at full extension. Mounting is difficult in supporting the TV weight while screwing in the back bracket. I would prefer a slot bracket with screws only for security.",0,Negative
"Very easy to install, very sturdy; I used this on my 26"" LCD HDTV...you really can't go wrong for the price, JUST BUY IT!The only thing I want to mention here; you may or may not have the same problem upon receiving the item; but, the HDMI cable and leveler shown in the picture and advertised as included were not in the box. Since this was sold by AMAZON.COM I contacted their customer service department but was given the runaround and told me to contact CheetahMounts directly on this issue.After contacting Cheetah Mounts they immediately shipped out an HDMI cable to my address, even though they told me it was an AMAZON.COM issue. FIGURES!Needless to say I got my HDMI cable but never got the LEVELER advertised. I really don't know who to blame on this one.The reason I gave 5 stars is that the product is an exceptional value...the only problems I had were with packaging/shipping.",0,Negative
An earlier review incorrectly said that a double-stud was needed to install this mount.  WRONG!  Read the instructions.For installation on a usual wall (with spaced wall studs) only use two large screws (one above the other).You use all four screws for masonry -- and I suppose few will be putting a smaller TV on a masonry wall.,2,Negative
"Mount seems sturdy enough but don't like the fact that the plate that attaches to the TV doesn't come off to mount the TV. You have to hold the TV up while you screw in 4 screws. Makes it a 2 person job. Haven't been able to use it yet because UPS did another wonderful job and destroyed the package. It arrived with the box battered and open with everything missing except a scratched up mount. Nice Job UPS. It was shipped in the retail box with no protection but it still should have made it in better shape. Cheetah Mounts was great and corrected the problem quickly and put up with my bitching. 5 stars for Cheetahs Cust service, 4 for the mount, 0 for the shipping.",4,Negative
I gave this 5 stars for a simple reason.the package arrived on time and had everything short of a screw gun needed to mount it.when I opened the box to watching tv took me less than10 minutes.2 minutes to disconect the arm connecting the tv plate from the wall plate.2 minutes each to connect the plate to the wall then the TV and a few minutes to reconnect the arm.If I had a second set of hands that would have taken 1 minute but holding the tv and connecting the arm was a little difficult.I did not need the extention plates as the base plate fit my 39&#34; toshiba tv.I have no reservation recommending this item and it came with an HDMI cord!!,2,Negative
"I purchased this mount a while back, and got a 40"" tv recently, does anyone know whether you could interchange the front plate of the mount to a 300mm by 300mm plate? I hate to waste it.",0,Negative
"Mount is sturdy, have 37&#34; on it. generally the motion is smooth for moving horizontally and in the z-axis. The tilt up/down setup is not. It's clearly meant to be set once and never adjusted. The design of the tilting mechanism is such that it requires that the TV be supported completely and then rotated. This essentially requires loosening the device, tilting the TV (by supporting it's weight with your hands), then tightening the device. Difficult to do alone, and not something you want to do often.",0,Negative
It works!! Everything is straight forward with no trick. The only difficulty is to hold the TV to mount it on the rack. That has nothing to do with the product.,4,Negative
"I am very stisfied with the quality of design, materials and workmanship of this mount.  When it's extended all the way, the TV can bounce, if you make it.  So it's not super rigid.  It is, very sturdy though.  The ball at the end allows for tilting, even rotating the TV.  Be aware that if you move this often, you'll have to straighten your tilted TV each time.  That's merely a trade-off for the versatility.I would highly recommend this, especially to someone who wants 20&#34; of extension from a mount.",2,Negative
"I was shocked by how difficult this mount is to install...This wasn't my first install but I am far from a pro.  I have used several mounts in my home, and this was by far the most difficult to install.Cable is nice but level is cheap.Seems sturdy but time will tell.",4,Negative
"I used two of these to mount my monitors from the wall. The arm is 20&#34;, which allows me to move them around quite a bit. They are solid and stiff, meaning the monitor will stay where you put it.I do have a pretty big caveat for this mount. The mounting plate does not remove from the arm. For the 27&#34; monitors I put on them, this is not a big deal. Holding them up to the plate and keeping the holes inline was difficult, even for the small monitors. This mount says it can mount up to 55&#34; TVs, which from a construction stand point is probably true, but it would be very difficult to hold it in place while someone else puts the bolts on. If you are mounting a tv, I suggest finding another mount where the plate separates from the mount.",2,Negative
"I have a 30"" Sony that weighs about 30 pounds mounted to this arm.If you level it folded up, then it's cockeyed when you move it out.If you level it out extended then it's cockeyed when you fold it back.After examination, there is too much slop in the joints.Even after tightening to the point of immobility it lacks the stiffness to properly support the TV without tilting to one side or the other.I can't see this being useful on anything but the smallest and lightest of monitors.The replacement has twin articulated arms. It was twice the price, but works 100 times better.I suspect all single joint arms suffer the same as this one.",0,Negative
Did get to try the product because it didn't fit my 32 inch TV. But  that was my fault because I should have called them and asked if it would fit.,0,Negative
"My boyfriend got this up and on the wall in no time.  I use it in my small home office which I also use as an exercise room.  The higher you put it in the wall, the longer the cords you may need to connect to a DVR or DVD player, unless you have an outlet in the middle of the wall.",3,Negative
"I can't recommend this mount for two big reasons.  It was extremely difficult to hang the TV, and we had three people holding the TV and one trying to screw in the screws.  The other problem is that it won't stay in a level position.  It droops towards the wall at the bottom.  I have tried to tighten the screws and it didn't do any good because it tightens against a cheap piece of plastic.  They are tightened as far as they can go.  Poor design and cheap quality of materials makes this an item to stay away from..",0,Negative
This mount's holding a 37&#34; TV with no problems. The only minor annoyance is it does seem to tilt down after adjusting.,2,Negative
"&#34;Successfully&#34; mounted my 47&#34; Vizio TV with this bracket. The tilt adjustment is absurd and impossible to use. The way the extension arms don't fit the TV is bizarre (TVs and monitors have standard holes! Why doesn't Cheetah know this?).... screws made of cheap metal that gets stripped easily. It was impossible to get the TV to stay in a particular tilt position, the instructions made no sense, and the clincher: one person has to hold up a 50 pound TV while the other person puts in four screws to fix it to the bracket. Why?!?!?!?In the end, I went to Costco and got a similar looking mount. It fit perfectly, is super sturdy and made perfect sense in every way. You fix a bracket to the TV and then just clip it on (of course). The new, Costco bracket cost almost twice as much, but it's worth every penny.THIS mount (Cheetah) what scares people away from DIY. Avoid!",0,Negative
"Maddening! My hubby and I have remodeled our home. That said, we have had our share of rolling eyes, eplectives and arguments. But we were pulling our hair out while assembling this. It is sooo dumb. It does not fit our Vizio 37&#34; despite others that said it worked.Problem #1: Unless your studs are EXACTLY on center, the unit will be off. ahhh. Go find one that has a sliding bar so you can do a mount on more than one stud and then move to find center.Problem #2: The square bracket required these additional 4 arms to be screwed on and then attached to the tv. The holes provided don't line up so only one screw is able to be used on each arm which means that it will lean A LOT off the wall. And honestly the screws never tightened up enough for our peace of mind. Addionally, despite all the serious screws and bolts that hold the mount to the wall, it does not matter one bit if your tv is really resting on some dinky little screws.Problem #3: the directions (albeit better than some electronic guides) leave a lot of questions and concerns.Problem #4: It doesn't come with alcohol.Problem #5: It states that you &#34;might&#34; need two people to mount the tv. Your kidding right? No crap, Captian Obvious.",0,Negative
"I've had well over six months of use with this product. I suspended a 32"" LCD TV in my sons room with it. It hasn't started to sag or give us any grief. My boys move the TV frequently to plug/unplug video game systems.Update after a year of constant use:Still holding strong, the brackets are still as tight as ever. I would buy another one if I needed it.",0,Negative
Very versatile!  The fours arms pivot to several positions.  And it had the ability to fit my Sony 40&#34; LCD nicely.  However - The jacks on my particular TV did not cooperate.  Regardless to how I manipulated the arms the plate was blocking access to many of the jacks.  I can't actually blame the Cheetah mount.  Bad luck?  Using the supplied spacers and long screws helped.  But I had to alter two arms by drilling extra holes.  My bad luck aside - I give this Cheetah mount 5 stars.,2,Negative
"If price weren't taken into consideration I would give this mount 2.5 stars, but since it is so inexpensive I give it 4. The joint hinges are very tight making it hard to extend the tv on and off of the wall without feeling like you are going to rip it out of the stud, and the manufacturer forgot to include the washers needed to mount the tv to the bracket. That being said, it is very sturdy, and for the price is a decent mount.",2,Negative
Mount is nice and cheap. However the TV is attached to the mount by a ball joint. The ball joint has 3 allen screws that may be tightened to hold the TV in place. Well the 3 screws are not enough. Our TV weighs 14lbs and it will not stay in place. It angles down and tilts to the side with no way to correct it.,0,Negative
"After attaching the four extensions to the mount, I used a stud finder and located a stud in the wall and screwed the mount ontothe wall. Then the TV was screwed onto the mount. It took about five minutes.  I prefer a mount that fits the size of my TV, butthis does the job of holding and swiveling the TV to face the bed. The price of the mount is the best I found.",2,Negative
"First off, there's not a whole lot to complain about when you get this for $25....that being said, this tv mount is definitely cheaply constructed.  It squeaked badly straight out of the box and the reason for that was a missing nylon washer on one of the articulating arms.  Those washers are there to prevent noise.  The quick remedy: I went to lowes and purchased some nylon plastic washers from the plumbing section for $1.50 and put them in.  The squeak is gone.  The other complaint about the mount is the tv mounting plate is not centered with the stud mount bracket when fully retracted.  This presented a problem because the stud above my fireplace is dead center and now the tv is off center 1.5"".  That stunk but I'll live.  Hope this helps!***update:  after leaving the tv mounted overnight, I woke up this morning to find the articulating arm bending and was resting on my mantle.  I had it mounted 3 inches above the mantle last night.  I'm sending this back ASAP!  Fyi: my television weighs 63 lbs and It says the weight limit is 65lbs so that must be when it breaks.......***",0,Negative
"After a preparing the wall, and making holes and finally mounting the TV... Disappointment. Some reviews pointed the same issue with the slacking of the arm with the weight of the tv is a fact. I went by all the positive reviews but cheap is what we pay and crap is what you get I guess is the situation. The mount itself is sturdy but the weight of the TV, which I purchsed is M320NV weighs about 20lbs will cause it to lean fwd. After all the hardwork to put it up, was pretty disappointing. I suggest go with another product. After all said and done it isnt worth taking it back off to put a new mount, plus the holes you will need to patch up.... Suggest go with a little more reliable mount then this one.",0,Negative
"Straightforward installation. Lots of tilt, turn and extension positioning. Great price. Everything included along with extra screws and spacers to fine tune the mounting. Very sturdy build.

Good and complete instructions",4,Negative
"My installer showed my a minor flaw on the mount, but for the size of the tv that I mounted, this flaw would not affect it.  Not the prettiest, but for a bedroom tv usage, it works.",3,Negative
"For the price, you cant beat it. It was very easy to install. No regrets. The HDMI cable and level were very convenient.",4,Negative
"This mount is heavy steel construction and looks robust enough to do the job (there's your two stars right there). However, I chose to return mine to Amazon and select a different mount. The reason: this design does not incorporate a removable VESA plate, so installation becomes a two-person job.I had expected to just fix the mount to the wall, attach the VESA plate to the TV, and then simply hang the TV with VESA plate attached onto the mount. Can't do it with this one. Since you cannot remove the VESA plate, you need to fix the mount onto the wall, then have someone hold the TV in the proper position while you attach it to the VESA plate. If you are mounting near the ceiling, you're doing this standing on a step ladder.I could have gotten someone to help, but I dislike stupid design and it ticked me off that this was even necessary. It would mean also getting help anytime I changed the TV, or if I wanted to use the mount in a different location.I'm returning this mount to Amazon, and replacing it with one of the mounts with removable VESA plate.",2,Negative
"After its installed, so far so good, but that's the key..getting it installed. There are absolutely no directions on how to mount the tv after you get it on the wall. All of the other brackets I have installed, (2) , have two straight pieces that are installed on the back of your tv & you hang it on the wall bracket, then tighten down the anchor screws. Not this one.That ""X"" piece is attached to the back of the tv then what? It can be figured out but there are no directions for that. You have to unscrew a pin with allen wrench , hold the tv in the air and line it up, then reinsert the pin. Two people is a must!! If not for the poor directions, I would give it a 5 because it does exactly what I needed it to do.What is so hard for these companies about putting complete directions in their products?",0,Negative

"Just so you know, this mount doesn't fit 200x100.I know it doesn't say it does but I thought it would cause they say it will fit up to 400x400.Also, this is the second mount from them that I've bought.The first one only tilts downwards, when I tilt it up, it slowly goes down again.Not a bit deal cause I put that tv up high so that it should always point down anyways.Anyways, don't buy this if you got a 200x100 tv...Updated on 20 Feb 2014This mount does fit 200x100.They emailed me about the issue based on my original 3* review and gave me a claim number.They said to either email or call.I emailed them back but after no reply in 2 days I called the number.I was informed that they tested it to ensure fit.I was informed to turn the mount sideways so that the holes line up.Afterwards, I can just turn the mount on the ball so that it is right side up.This fixed my issue right up!Glad they got back to me because I was about to buy another mount.For the other issue, I was informed that I just have to tighten up the screws around the ball to keep it from falling back down.I was also told that because it was a few years old, it's an older model, the new and improved doesn't have this issue as easily.Either way, keep the screws tighten as needed.",0,Negative
"I found this wall mount easy to install and very sturdy.  It seemed heavier than the 32"" inch flat screen tv I mounted with it.  It included all the parts I would ever need for whatever tv I was mounting or wall situation.  It is made to install on a single stud with one lag screw top and bottom.  It had a nice (plastic) cover to cover the wall mount and lag screws with.  I didn't have a problem with the tv sagging or being level.  As soon as I screwed the flat panel to the mount it was there like a bear.  I did need help from my neighbor holding the tv while I lined up the mount to the holes on the tv.  I haven't played with the tilt yet.  There is an adjustment for that.  The scissor like arm that you can push or pull the tv away from the wall was a little stiff.  It will probably loosen up over time but you can tighten it up with the allen wrenchs they supply with the hardware.  Mine is a set it and forget it type of install so I had no problems with it.  It was a lot cheaper than some of the Sanus mounts I looked at and just as sturdy.  I had free shipping and it came a day early.",0,Negative

"The item works fine, seems very sturdy, and depending on the seller, can be bought for under 20 dollars. Unfortunately, the item sags once the tv is mounted. I wouldn't make the purchase again. I have the equivalent from monoprice, and it is much more sturdy.",4,Negative
"This would be a 5-star review except there are no screw-holes in the very center of the unit, which unfortunately is where my studs are.  So I used wall anchors on the sides and screws with washers under and adjacent to the frame in the center to mount it to the stud.  It wouldn't have been that difficult to cut another screw opening in the center.Apart from that, I got a sturdy TV mount plus some neat extras (bubble level and HDMI cable) for a ridiculously low price.",1,Negative
"I'm really happy that the mount is lightweight and puts together fine for a 32in that weighs surprisingly little. It takes no time to mount this up with the proper tools and mounting kit. The mounting kit is where this product went wrong. The smallest bolts, m4,are too short and the head is too small. even with the lock washer they provide, it will go through the mount holes when mounting the bracket to the tv. They provide washers which I'm assuming is for the large screws for the mounting plates, but there's only 3 that fit the large screws and one that fits the smallest bolt for mounting the bracket to the TV. I had to buy extra bolts and washers to mount my bracket and used a larger washer laying around for the large screws that goes in the wall. I have bought and mounted 4 other cheetah mounts and this model is the worst.",0,Negative
The little handels are to close to the TVs back panel. It is a pain to adjust tilt without removing the Tv  from the support.,0,Negative
"I have used cheetah mounts many times for my clients installations. I purchased a Cheetah APTMSB for a 32 "" TV I was hanging in a wall unit. Today I did the install and was really annoyed with the bracket. First the screws that mount the hanging brackets to the back of the TV had much smaller heads than the holes in the bracket. So it was time to get the washers out of the bag. The washers they supplied had a center hole that was twice the size of the the screw head. So I had to run out to a hardware store, and purchase washers that would fix the problem. Secondly the hanging brackets that adjusted the angle for the TV angle had screws with no nuts at all to lock the TV in position.So back to the hardware store now for nuts to lock the TV in position. Two hours wasted. By the time I was done I told myself no more cheetah mounts. I suggest buyers go for another brand the quality is going down .",0,Negative

"The Cheetah mount is a great combination of ruggedness, simplicity and price.  We followed instructions, assembled and installed the unit, and had the 32"" LCD mounted and operating within an hour.  I have no idea why local stores charge 4-5 times the price for a wall mount with no more capability than the Cheetah mount.We set the tilt angle before we attached the TV and avoided the adjustment issues mentioned in other ratings.",0,Negative
"Used this mount to put a 32 LCD TV on the wall. It's low profile helps keeps everything from intruding into the room. Since I bought an inexpensive TV, it did not come with mounting screws. Those included with the mount were not small enough. Luckily, I had saved mounting screws from another installation and it had the requisite screws. We did use the tilt feature which works well for a fixed setting.",4,Negative
"I needed a mount for a 32"" LCD for a bedroom wall.  Wanted nothing special (pan, tilt etc) and also wanted a very low cost.  This product fits all of those things. The only less than 5 star I'd award it is the design of tightening the final two mounting screws, which are in a hard to reach spot on the lower back.  If you have a long screw driver or really small hands this won't be an issue.",0,Negative
"This mount is based on a false premise: that a flat mounting bracket is superior to a standard mount. Nothing can be further from the truth.I mount about two large-screen TV's each week, and use a regular type wall mount. One recent customer demanded a flat mount that I discouraged him from getting. He found this one on Amazon, and who was I to argue with a paying customer?This design is tragically flawed. Nothing I write here is personal opinion (that is, I don't dislike it because of the color, price, shape or strange personal prefs). I don't like this flat-mount simply because this is the worst TV mount available.The only positive is the price is acceptable, in fact cheap, at just $25. For that sum you get a mount that you have to assemble (it comes in a tiny box), which was not a hassle at all.You mount it to the wall with the supplied lag bolts, which are heavy duty. The mounting rail and brackets appear fairly sturdy, so I had no fears that it would fail to support a 110 lb 55"" Panasonic Viera plasma TV. I would NOT trust this to plastic wall anchors. Unless you have two studs to mount the Cheetah rail onto, I wouldn't risk it. It would be sheer insanity to expect plastic mounts to support this weight, in my opinion.MAJOR PROBLEM: This mount is simply not wide enough for a 55"" TV, which is what it is designed for. The mounting holes on the back of the TV on this particular set are 32"" apart. The wall-mounted rail that the TV brackets are supposed to slide onto is 32.5"" long. That leaves a mere 1/2"" of wiggle room. I had my customer help me lift in onto the mount. This took, no kidding, 45 minutes of lifting 110 lbs up, sliding it down the wall (which of course left marks on his white wall), trying to get BOTH brackets to engage the rail with very small tolerances. We could always get one bracket to find the wall-mounted rail, but unless you are spot-on, it will not engage both. And with just "" to spare, I do mean SPOT-ON. I was stiff and sore by the time we hit the "" ""sweet"" spot and BOTH brackets found the mounting rail. Frustrating doesn't even begin to describe this experience. A couple of times we had to stop for a break for fear of dropping the TV. It was just way too tight a fit.Then there's the tilt feature, reportedly 15 degrees. Since the flat mount puts the TV just two, yes two (2), inches from the wall, it was literally impossible to look behind the TV to find the adjusting screws on the bracket that is screwed to the TV. This does not use hand-turn knobs that you can blindly reach for; you need to try to stick your arm between the wall and TV, get a screwdriver to line up with the tiny screws on BOTH sides, loosen them, adjust the TV tilt, then repeat the process to tighten it. Well, my arm is more than 2"" thick, so I could not reach behind to set the 15-degree tilt to the client's tastes. I told him that we'd have to UNMOUNT it from the wall, adjust the brackets to an eyeball approximation, and remount the TV and see if the new tilt was preferable. After the first 45 minute mounting experience, needless to say, he was not a fan of this proposal. So, his $2500 TV is at a tilt he does not like one bit.Now, since it weighs a ton, this TV is not going to fall off. But if we WANTED to secure it, we would have had to attempt the very same screw-tightening feat of magic from the bottom of the set, turning two screws which hook the lower ends of the TV-mounted brackets to the bottom portion of the rail. We had his 6-year old daughter try. She 1) could not see the screws because even with the side of her head pressed firmly against the wall, her eye is more than 2"" from the wall meaning she could not see the screws on the bottom of the bracket behind the TV; and 2) she could not, despite multiple attempts, reach behind the TV to even find the securing screws. So, it's hooked to the top rail, and the bottom rail is doing nothing. It is not supporting the weight of the TV OR securing it from falling off. But again, at 110 lbs, it's not going to lift itself off the top rail, so that's not a concern.These issues are not possible to overcome. It is not idiosyncratic. It is the burden you accept when you use a flat mount of this type.Why not get one that mounts your TV 6"" from the wall versus 2"" and allow yourself access to the tilt adjustment and locking screws?This close fit to the wall also makes it impossible to attach cables AFTER it is mounted. On this TV set, the HDMI/USB/AV plugs are on the side, and you have to try a blind stick of the cable into a hole you can't see. No matter where the plugs were, there is NO WAY you are going to get cables into a two-inch space to attach cables once it's on the wall. It's literally impossible. And I don't use that word lightly. Luckily, we attached the cables BEFORE our 45"" mounting odyssey. (Of course, since the cables were dangling when we were lifting the TV, they would invariably fall out, meaning we'd have to set it down, plug the cable back in, and start over.) One cable unfortunately fell out when we were done getting the TV on the wall, and we were unable to reinsert it because, as stated, we can't see behind the TV. So, he now has two, not three, HDMI cables available for peripheral devices. And trust me, we were not going to take it down to stick that single HDMI cable back in. I would have gladly walked off the job.I would only recommend a Cheetah flat mount for masochists and sick individuals who want to kill themselves when so many better mounts are available, albeit at a slightly higher price.From now on, if a client insists on a flat mount, I'm referring them to another installer. My back hurt the next day from lifting that massive plasma for 45 minutes up the wall, sliding it up/down over and over and over (and over again), finding we missed the mounting rail each time. It was a true nightmare.That's never happening to me again. And if you disregard this post, don't say I didn't warn you.==========UPDATE 12/16/13Cheetah apparently reads every Amazon review, because they contacted me about my negative comments. They offered either an upgraded mount, or a total refund and I keep the one I have. Since there's no way I'm dismounting this TV, I accepted their refund offer. That's pretty good customer service, and they promised they would take my comments into account on new design proposals. You can't beat that with a stick.Thanks Cheetah!!",0,Negative
"Does its job, hides behind the TV. Issues are as follows:a) Too little clearance behind the TV to plug in the wires or make changes.b) Tilt action has 2 hooks on each side and either you leave them lose or tighten them in place for a fixed tilt angle, changing them is not easy as the bolt for the inside hooks are hard to reach esp. given the clearance from the wall and the height and depth of the bolt from the side.c) Screws to the bottom are too difficult to reach and you could get into an issue with removing the TV if these screws are too tight i.e. if you need to pull the TV down and rehang it.d) Level bubble is off do not rely on it and buy yourself a better one from another source.e) Overall the the mount is sturdy and cheap compared to retail but there are issues that need to be dealt with.f) Worked flawlessly with my Sony 55"" 3D TV no issues hooking it up.",0,Negative
"This is a sturdy mount, as far as being able to fully support larger TVs... but the design is not as good as the mounts with a one-piece backing.

Prior to purchasing this online be sure to check your wall stud length and the space inbetween the holes in the TV.

Had been looking for one of these for my daughter.  The price in stores were anywhere from 100.00 and up. Thinking this one wqas a very cheap knockoff I was hesitant in buying it.

"I'm sorry, but I just couldn't spend more than $150 on an LCD TV mount; so I waited until someone put out a cheaper alternative. There's just no reason an LCD mount should cost $150+.When I saw the Cheetah I was actually a little concerned, thinking that at around twenty bucks it might be a little too cheap and might not be that solid. No one wants to lose their $800 TV because they're too cheap to buy a decent mount.Fortunately, the reviews looked really good, so I decided to buy one.It's solid. This thing is not coming off the wall, even in an earthquake, due to the locking screws on the bottom. I don't know why you would pay more.OK, that's not entirely true. I would pay a little more for a unit with some leveling features. The unit I got didn't have the built-in leveling bubble -- and I think it made a difference. Because of how you screw this thing into the wall, the mounting plate can move up and down just a bit as you're screwing it in -- something I'd have realized had there been the promised built-in level. I'm not sure why they decided to skimp on this. I own a level; they could have kept the PoS (and it is a PoS) level they included and just left the one that used to be built into the mounting plate instead.This would have been a non-issue if they'd made the unit adjustable. Fortunately, I was able to put some thin metal shims (I used some box-cutter blades from a dollar store razor I had sitting around) on one side of the plate's mounting channel so that the TV was a little higher on the right side. Now it's level and I was still able to secure it with the bottom locking screws so that it won't fall off the mounting plate if we have an earthquake. So in the end, it was a minor issue.I would buy it again (and i might buy one for my other TV) unless someone sells an adjustable unit for roughly the same price. Otherwise I'll just go to the dollar store and buy another box cutter (don't worry, the blades aren't going to slip out, and the sharp ends are not exposed).Buy this. If you're handier than I am you might not have any problems. If you're handily challenged like me, just buy a box cutter with extra blades for the dollar store. You can't beat this for the price.",2,Negative

"Third Cheetah mount I have purchased, but this one is the smallest.  It comes in 4 pieces, unlike the larger ones.

"The bracket itself is fine and very sturdy. The integrated level is a nice touch as is the included separate 3 direction level. Once you get the main bracket on the wall, all is good.Pros:1) Solid construction2) Easy to put Flat Panel TV on or take off the bracket3) If you can use the lag bolts to mount it into wall studs, those work fine4) InexpensiveCons:1) Other mounting hardwareMy issue is that the way my daughters room wall studs are setup where I wanted to put the TV, I could only use one lag bolt. I needed to use wall anchors for the other three mounting points. It turns out that the toggle bolts that they include do not fit through the mounting holes of the wall bracket. Even if you unscrew the toggle bolts and then pre-screw them onto the bracket, you can't pound the toggle through the wall because there isn't enough clearance for the flaps to fully fold back and clear the back of the sheetrock.Basically, the toggle bolts for drywall mounting are completely useless. The wall anchors they provide are not much better since they are too long for typical 1/2"" sheetrock. The spines that hold them in place are too far down so that if you put them in flush to the wall, they spin in place when you try to tighten the lag bolts.2) The tilt set screws use a dumbbell-like bar, but on one of the TV brackets tightening it had the bar in a 90 degree position relative to the back of the TV so it stuck out. Trouble is that this bracket is very close to the wall and there wasn't enough clearance. So, I had to really crank it down just to get it to an angle where the TV would go on the wall. I was afraid of stripping the set screw.So, the long and short of it is that the bracket itself is OK, but go out and get several heavy duty drywall anchors at your local hardware store because the included drywall anchors and toggle bolts are useless.",2,Negative
"The kit looks much better and more sturdy in the pictures. In reality, they used thin metal and smaller frame for the product. It served the purpose for me as I was mounting a relatively smaller TV (32 inches). However, I am not sure how comfortable I will feel mounting a 40-42 inch on it. The directions to mount were generally good however, the one about screwing in the sidebars and picture given was confusing. It took a bit to make sense out of it.

"This gets 4 stars because it's a good value for what is included in the kit.Plenty of screws, lag bolts, washers, spacers and an HDMI cable that seems to be of a decent, albeit loudly patterned, quality.It does it's job.That said, there are probably sturdier mounts out there. The old mount I used for this TV was very sturdy. It stuck out from the wall a couple of inches, where this one is almost flush. I am using it with a 46 inch TV that is quite heavy. This listing doesn't specify a weight, nor does the manual. This similar one,Cheetah Mounts APTMM2B Bracket 32 65 Inchwhich is for a 700mm mount pattern states 165lbs, so this one should be similar. I would be hesitant to load it to that weight. If the lag bolts into the wall aren't on the ends of the mount, or near where the TV brackets hook, it will flex and pull away from the wall. The ability to angle is useful, but a very limited range. I also had a hard time hooking the TV to the mount. Several times it felt like it was hooked, and as I started to let go, shifted off the mount. I'm not sure what it was getting stuck on. My previous mount was very easy to remove and re-install the TV by myself, but this mount was impossible without two people, which is my major complaint.",0,Negative
"This mount did a good job of spanning three unevenly-spaced metal wall studs and supporting a 30-pound 42-inch TV. However, one of the side-bar screw holes was out of alignment with the slot in the top member. I had to use a small file to elongate the slot.Mounting the hanger on the metal studs was a bigger problem. I bought toggle screws that were supposed to be able to pass through 1/2-inch holes. However, the ends of the pins on the toggles extend a bit beyond that.  No problem if mounting only on wallboard; big problem on metal studs. I had to use the side of the drill bit, and a round file to elongate the six holes for the toggle pins. This would be a problem for any hanger mounted on metal studs, not just this one.",2,Negative

That said, that's exactly what I did with it. It actually works well for me as the angle brings it a foot closer to where I'm viewing it. I have a 40&#34; LCD that's a newer model and not all that heavy.

The tilting has to be done before you hang it, otherwise, when the bottom screws are in place, it is also impossible because the gap between the mount and the TV is too small/narrow making hands not able to reach.  2.

Throw them out and buy some quality lags same size etc... twice while installing this, the lag bolts snapped while snugging the mount up to the wall and tightening them and I really wasn't over tightening them.

"At the end of the day, all a TV mount is is a piece of metal that you attach to the wall, with a pair of hangers that you attach to the TV. There's no reason that should cost hundreds of dollars, especially when you've got a perfectly solid option like this VideoSecu model for a fraction of the price.I've bought a number of these over the years, all to mount heavy plasma sets, and I've never had a problem or a failure. The pieces are made from heavy-grade powder-coated steel and include all the hardware you could need to mount up any TV you might own. Wall bolts are included for wooden stud mounting, but no toggles or sheet metal screws for drywall or metal stud mounting. Once it's up on the wall and into studs, it's not coming down. I've hung off of one before and it didn't shift, bend, or budge. It does have a level built-in, and it's probably accurate enough, but use a larger level to mount it if you can.All in all, I can't think of an argument against this mount if you're in the market.

"Pros:- Works great with Sharp Aquos LC-46D85UN 46"" LCD TV.- Quite solid for its much-lower price point.  Attaches to wall with included heavy 1/2"" lag screws.- Plenty of play in the wall mounts for different stud placements; plenty of play in the TV brackets for different TV models.  Even includes toggle anchors if you *really* have to go studless, but the instructions specifically recommend against it.- Hand-tightened lock screws also hold tilt position.  Once you've chosen the ""slide"" position, lock screws also hold that in place so it doesn't slide during earthquakes.- Tons of hardware included for different models.  Takes a short while to figure out which screws / lock nuts are right for your TV.- Includes a level on the wall plate AND a hand level for your toolkit.- Wall plate is symmetrical on 2 axes so there is no accidental upside-down.Cons:- Very level-sensitive.  If the wall plate is off even by a little bit, there's no way to adjust level of the TV after the fact.- Tilt is a little hard to adjust while the unit is on the wall, unless you have small hands.- Hanging the TV on it takes a bit of effort, mostly because it's hard to line up the hooks with the rail; you have to be accurate to within a couple inches vertically, or another piece gets in the way.- Instruction sheet needs some polish (it has weird font changes, a few typos).",0,Negative
I loved this TV mount. It is easy to install and use. The only issue is that its really heavy. Its 4 times heavier then my 60&#34; LED TV. But that does not bother me as the TV is light.Just keep in mind that this will not fit on a wall which has studs 24&#34; apart. You will have insert wood in between the wall to hold the mount or if the TV is light you could take the risk of installing one end to the stud and the other end to the dry wall (i will not recommend it though),2,Negative

"This mount fits my 60"" Panny ST60 just fine. The TV weighs about 70 lbs, and the mount holds steady to the stone fireplace. I decided on this mount vs the Cheetah mount, as the Videosecu had a smaller footprint on the fireplace for mounting. It was difficult to get the base perfectly level, as the stone's on the fireplace are not flush with one another. The nice thing about the mount, are the many adjustments that can be made to correct the leveling. The kit came with concrete anchors, and screws for a fireplace mount. Unfortunately, the screws used to mount the brackets which hang the TV to the mount were too short by 1mm, according to the Panny instruction manual. I had to run to a store, and grab M8 20mm 1.25 pitch screws. Not that big of a deal. The other negative about my particular kit, was the hardware was mislabeled. It seems like they were vacuum sealed one compartment off. Once I figured that out, it was fairly smooth sailing. Also, the mount cannot fold completely back, as the concrete screws stick out where the arms fold into. Again, not a big issue, as we are talking maybe a 1/4"".Pros:Numerous adjustmentsSolid buildStraight forward instructionsPriceCons:Mislabelled packagingDoesn't sit completely flatScrews did not fit my tv",2,Negative
"The build quality of the TV mount is very good and paint is excellent. I am a mechanical engineer and liked the design from the pictures.  After receiving the system, I question the mounts useful weight capacity. The description states it is designed to support TVs up to 200 pounds, but the practical use of this mount on anything above 100 pounds is questionable.  My 50&#34; plasma TV weighs 88 pounds.  The TV sags a full one-inch when it is extended from the wall 14 inches.  I had to raise the mount after attaching the TV and seeing that it sagged so much.  My application is a corner with bookcases surrounding it on both sides.My application is the typical wood stud and sheet rock construction. The wall frame must be screwed into the wood studs and it was not possible to center the TV mount exactly on center of the studs (16 inch-on-center studs offset from TV center by 8 inches). This may have contributed slightly to the sagging. The TV is difficult to manipulate with the sagging of the system.  I almost lost the TV when the frame sagged left to right on the adjustable pivoting arm. Articulating arm mounts put a lot of stress in several directions and need to be built with heavier construction.",2,Negative
works well--very sturdy--but very heavy.  Quality lag screws should be used when installing this mount.  This a dual scissors type arm--not the single swing arm seen on some mounts.,1,Negative
"Just put this up, had no issues at all. I did replace the 6 lag screws with 1/4"" x 2.5"" lag screws (I used .20"" pilot holes). I actually push-drilled a bunch of pilot holes to ensure that I was screwing into the center of the stud, instead of off to the side of the stud (where it may split). Since the pilot holes would be covered by the TV mount, I didn't care.I was able to use the included M6 screws (the shorter ones) to screw the included brackets to my Sony Bravia 46"" with no issues.I was able to do pullups on the mount after I had all the screws in (I weight 175lbs), it's solid. A no-brainer purchase at this price.",0,Negative
It is a good wall mount but the main mount that attaches to the wall was bent and noticed it after mounting everything.  After all that work it wasn't worth taking down and it still worked but in any product you don't want &#34;damage&#34; and i consider it damaged.  who knows if it is as sturdy without it being a little bent.  we'll see and i'll change my rating if it holds up.  When you attach the main piece to the wall make sure its laying flush!,2,Negative

"This mount is very sturdy and I could not find any noticeable defect with it.  It articulates very well (you will have to loosen some nuts to make it easier) and has most everything I would want in a mount.  The only downside I could find to this mount is the cable management system isn't that great, but that's not really a big deal as there are many other ways to manage cables effectively without depending on the mount.I installed the mount with four (4) lag screws (provided) into wooden studs and it worked great.  I fully extended the arm and hung off it (I weigh 150 lbs.) and it didn't even creak.  Once it was pulled tight I noticed it was a few degrees off from center, which kills my OCD, but the adjustment screws on the back made up for it so the TV is perfectly level now.  All of the adjustment mechanisms are very easy to use and can be done by a single person.I would highly recommend this mount. I used this for a 60&#34; Vizio LED TV.",2,Negative
"Poor adjustments for the tilt and difficult to mount. I nearly had to dismantle the thing to get it on the wall. The back plate is too short. It is only 18 inches. My stud fell right in the middle, so I had to alter the wall to get enough support. The back plate should be 24 inches or more. I would not buy this again.",2,Negative

"This is a heavy-duty TV mount. At least it looks that way. I ordered it a while ago and when I finally got around to opening the box, I found one knob cracked into multiple pieces and two carriage bolts missing. I considered  returning it but given  that I paid $27-plus for shipping, I wasn't inclined to pay another $27-plus to return it. Any way, the vendor allows returns in less than 30 days and I was past the point of no return. Instead, I contacted the vendor to see if I could get the parts that I needed and never heard back from them. So, bottom line, I can't recommend the product or the vendors Warehouse Dealers.",0,Negative
I have purchased several of these for jobsite trailers and the ywork very well. take a little time to assemble but they are very solid and can do the job with no troubles. Worth every penny!,4,Negative
It seems strong enough. It comes from the factory tightened to the extreme. I have to loosen the bolts to almost falling off just to be able to adjust anything. I fear that once I get the TV mounted that I wont be able to make any adjustments because then I wont be able to get my spanner wrench in place. Anyone got ideas on this?Edit 9/13/13 I had to mount it with the major nuts at the joints a bit loose and wd40'd. It seems to be secure and moves as easy as can be. I hope nothing goes loose and it collapses. So I change the rating to a 5 star...until further re edit!,0,Negative

"Don't buy this mount if you need side shift capability.  Amazingly the rear plate also ofers no ability to mount to 16"" on center studs as its shorter then 16""  I would say mounting plate is only 14""  so terrible design IMO. It offers very limited 1-2"" of side shift due to its design we used on a 42"" samsung and didn't need the side shift so we kept it.  It also sticks out from the wall about 2"" more then competing mounts if that matters to you.  The amount of side shift is determined by the mounting holes on your tv so if they are close together say 12-18""  you will have the issue.",2,Negative
"The only negative about this item is that it causes your TV to protrude from the wall when in a flattened position.  If you want your TV to truly lay flat against the wall, or awfully close to flat, this won't do the trick.  But I have no fear that the TV will fall or that it will release from the wall when extended.",2,Negative
"Simply put, this thing is sturdy and has ALL the features at 1/2 the price. I went out and purchased some longer lag screws just because I wanted to be sure, but the ones they sent with it probably would have worked. I have a 60 inch TV and I didn't want to find out I was wrong. Tilts, swivels and moves in and out from the wall. Make sure you have studs to mount this to if you have a heavy TV. I don't think you want to mess with mollies or lag shields in the drywall. This is a good buy.",2,Negative

"My install took a little longer than typical, because I wasn't going to open my network or install software just to use the camera.  [A lot of time was spent figuring out what MAC address to allow onto my WiFi router.  The WiFi MAC address not the LAN MAC address.  Duh.]  Also, I configured it at home with one network and moved it on-site into a different network.The diagnostics could be more detailed, to allow for debugging.  All of my difficulties were in setting up the e-mail feed and the FTP feed, but that is not really the camera's fault.  More diagnostics would have made it easier.If I have any complaints, it would be that the camera does not have a setting to turn off all of the LED indicators on the camera.  That makes it hard to install an unobtrusive camera if it flickers whenever it senses motion.  Fortunately, by the time some vandal sees the camera and grabs it, the images will have been safely uploaded.  We'll see how errant animals react to the camera.  I don't think they'll care about the LEDs.  Raccoons can be sneaky though - I worry that they'll cut the battery power to the WiFi router before breaking in.",0,Negative
"Although the ASTAK camera is one of the better ones I've tried -- these things are notoriously poorly designed, in my opinion -- I've had this thing running uninterruptedly for 23 months now.PASSWORD SETUPOn a wireless network, one is supposed to change the access password every so often.  After about two years, I decided to do that to my home network (Apple).But then the camera's network didn't work any more.  I clicked about a lot on ASTAK's screens and nothing happened. I followed the procedure on the setup screen, which I eventually found -- it requires you to find an old network cable from your junk-cable box, and use that.  Of course the first 2 cables I tried didn't work, so I was quite frustrated. (I think some of these cables, although they are alike on the outside aren't guaranteed to be the same as the cable needed here).  Be that as it may, I tried a third cable that worked and the setup proceeded after that. After giving my new password to the prompt in the stup, all was fine.NB:  To get my WiFi iMac, iPad, etc. to work, I didn't need a cable... All I needed was my new password :)MEMORY CARD and FRI CTIONWhile I'm at it and have the Mole Cam down from its perch, I'd like to swap out the SD card to put a higher capacity one into the camera.  Nowhere on the card slot is it specified what the maximum memory capacity is that this thing will take before puking.  WHY?  Why not?  Do the gentleman at ASTAK want me to go rummaging through my things ftom two years ago to find what its specs are?  The lettering on the back of the camera is, of course, printed in tiny letters, black on black.  Thank you, Astak!  Why designers and programmers and their managers insist on such causing FRICTION in the use of a product is beyond me!  Take a lesson from the likes of Apple and THINK before you kick your product over the fence to the sales department!SOUNDAnother irritating thing about this setup is that there is no VOLUME control.  Sure, I can use the computer's control to diminish the echo from the cam, but this s/b a native feature.FUTURE PURCHASEWhen I initially set this thing up I found many more frustrating things about the ASATK cam, but it's been two years now and I don't remember everything -- but I remember that!  :(. And I'll remember THAT if I'm ever in the position to consider an ASTAK product for purchase.*** UPDATE ***It's a year later now and the thing is starting to make loud noises!",0,Negative

"Purchased this for my 23"" apple cinema display. The materials used to construct this mount solution are Inconsistent taking away from the apple display's contemporary look. When mounted, the vertical action is not smooth, almost requiring two people to adjust it. The whole solution is not as sturdy as the video indicates. The desk clamp allows a surface thickness of 1 1/3"" which wasnt enough for the desk. As such I had to drill a hole through my desk to use the alternative mount option to secure the visidec. In conclusion, I think this solution was poorly executed, but for $70, I might be expecting to much.20101128 Review Update:I seem to have located my problem with the arm. The swing arm locks on to the vertical pole using a grip lock which uses as a sleeve to wedge it's self onto the pole. That sleeve is broken, causing the swing arm to lock on the pole even when the grip lock was in the open position. I have contacted Visidec, and they have at their own cost shipped me a new one. I will provide a newer update once the replacement part arrives.",3,Negative
"This mounting bracket is pretty good and the price is right, but there are a couple things that made me reduce its rating by 2 stars.The first thing you should consider for this or any TV wall mount is the width of the mounting plate vs. the spacing of the wall studs where you want to hang it.  This mount allows for a maximum 16 inches between the lag bolts.  I found that the wall where I wanted to hang my TV had 24 inches between studs.  So what I thought was going to be a couple hour project had an extra day added to it because I had to go buy a 2x10 plank, cut it, sand it, paint it, drill the pilot holes, then mount IT to the wall before I could mount the bracket to it.  The instructions only assumed the wall stud spacing was no wider than the mounting plate and gave no hint as to what to do otherwise.The other ding against this product is because it didn't come with all the right bits and pieces to attach the TV to the bracket.  It had 2 sizes of screws and in 2 lengths to put the TV on the bracket.  The 2 lengths of the larger screws were too short or too long, and no washers supplies for the larger screws per the instructions.  I had to hunt around in my garage for 2 sets of extra washers:  one to put on the screws as instructed, and another to fill the space because the screws were just a bit too long.Also check all of the bolts on the bracket before hanging the TV, a few on the one I got were a bit loose.",2,Negative
"I knew I wasn't buying the Rolls Royce of tv brackets at this price, but I still figured it would work.  This bracket has been an absolute headache to install!!The mounting screws to the tv only come in two sizes, too long or too short.  The washers to adjust the length of the screw are a joke, and didn't help at all.  So, I had to make a trip to the hardware store to get the right size.After mounting the bracket to the wall and the back plate to the tv, it was time to join the two.  WRONG!  With a helper, we lifted the tv and aligned the brackets, only to find that the plate that attaches to the TV was not big enough to fit on the bracket.  We were absolutely shocked that it was so grossly mis-fit.  We had to take a grinder and take off nearly 1/8&#34; of the tv plate just to get it to sit on the bracket.In other words, spend a little bit more money and save your time by getting a quality tv mount bracket.",0,Negative

There is ample hardware provided to match up to most TVs and the instructions were clear.  As long as you are comfortable accurately locating your wall studs and centering the 4 holes needed for the lag bolts, then you should have no trouble with this project.  Again, my main issue was the missing HDMI cable, but it didn't affect the installation.  Since I didn't want to dismount the bracket from my wall to do an exchange, Amazon issued me a partial refund based on the missing item which was fine.",0,Negative

"this was under $40 with free supersaver shipping, and it was totally worth it, mounts my beautiful 46"" Toshiba 1080p 120hz LED TV and makes it look even more beautiful. the only problem, the reason why it's 3 stars, is because the thing didnt come with the right screws for going in the back of the tv so I had to use the longer ones, which meant I had to go out and buy some nuts to make my tv not slip around. The HDMI cord looked like better quality than the cheapest ones I've bought on amazon (the only ones I buy because they work) because of the thicker shielding, but I was mistaken, when I plugged it in it made strange distortions on my tv and worked some of the time and other times it cut out completely.",0,Negative
"First I think the mount is built well, that is, it doesn't sag and the materials are substantial.The issues I have are in the implementation of the design.  The mount makes the TV sit out from the wall over 4 inches, so the thin TV is not hugging the wall enough for me.The other thing is that the mounting plate that goes against the wall is not really long enough, so its difficult to center the TV where you would like it securely.The third issue is that the mount allows the TV to rotate.  Not sure why that is, as the first 2 issues made me not want to work with it any more.  Perhaps removing the TV and tightening some mount bolts would have fixed this.",0,Negative
"DONT BUY THIS MOUNT. Ok that's strong BUT warranted. THe mount is ONLY 17&#34; long. That's just long enough to cake it to two studs. IF those two studs place the mount somewhere other than where you want the TV to be centered you have 3&#34; of &#34;wiggle room&#34; to move the mount left or right. MOST mounts have a wall plate that is over 20&#34; long which allows you to hit two studs AND center the mount where YOU want.The way THIS mount is &#34;centered&#34; is that the TV moves left or right on the extended bracket. To make a bad situation worse, The hardware used to rotate the TV has washers that are too thin and too small. They collapse when attempting to lock the rotation down.Bottom line is, stay away from it. Yes it is cheap, but cheap sucks when the tv isn't where you want it.Oh yeah I almost forgot, most mounts theses days are nice enough to include a built in bubble level..... this one isn't one of those.",2,Negative
If you're mounting a large HDTV up to 60&#34; this is a steal.  The slim profile makes it look as if the TV is a window or picture frame.  Very satisfied. No need to spend $50+ from those retail ripoffs.,1,Negative
"The only reason I didn't give this unit 5 stars is that it's a bit clumsy and awkward to install--with the back mount coming, as it does, in two pieces which is by no means obvious from the photograph.  You almost need two people to get it assembled and mounted correctly.  It can be done with one person, but a second pair of hands would speed up the operation considerably.  As for its function, it is study and does the job fine.It's a bit awkward to lock in the bottom of the T.V., but that was mainly because I don't have it mounted high on a wall, but lower on a piece of furniture that has 23/32nds&#34; plywood mounted to it, that is the then base for this &#34;wall&#34; mount unit.  But, again, furniture or wall, the awkwardness in this bottom locking is mainly because there is no light between this unit and whatever it is mounted to--thus, another set of hands with a flashlight (or some means of securing the flashlight to something so it's pointing at the work) is pretty much a must.",0,Negative

"This is an amazing wall mount, especially for the low low price. I unwrapped the package and my TV was securely mounted to the wall with cables hidden neatly behind it within 15 minutes flat. The mount I received included a built-in level and many mounting holes so it would be flexible and adaptable to virtually any TV set. They even included 5 different lengths and diameters of mount screws, wall stud bolts, and concrete anchors so no matter what TV you have or what surface you are mounting to, it is included! I am not easily impressed and I envisioned having to drill some holes in this thing or bend parts to fit my setup but it just went together smoother than I could have possibly imagined. I could not recommend any mount higher than this.Notes:1. This thing is low profile and does not tilt or swivel in any way so if you need that, look for a different model.2. The outside of the box says ""Holds up to 165 lbs"" but the included instructions warn ""The TV must not exceed 110 lbs"". Does any TV weight close to this much anyway?3. The box says ""Tilting TV wall mount"" but I assure you this thing bolts solid to the wall in a single position straight on and does not tilt. I did not want this feature so it is no problem for me.",2,Negative

"I have installed two of these this week.  The first, on an unobstructed wall, was a snap.  The hardest part was finding wall studs.  Tightening the locking screws was a little difficult, but not bad.  The mount is sturdy, simple, and functional.  I had no problems with the mounting screws, did not need spacers, and found the attached level as accurate as my own (or as accurate as my workmanship.)  The second installation was in a cabinet alcove built into my new house.  Everything went as before, until it came time to tighten the locking screws.  The bottom of the TV is only about 4 inches above the cabinet below, the sides are obstructed by other cabinetry, and, of course, the low-profile mount puts the TV only about 1 1/2 inches from the wall.  So far, I have found no way to reach the locking screws. (I am not too worried about this; I think only an earthquake will bring it down without being locked.)If you are mounting this on a readily accessible wall, give it 5 gold stars for simplicity, sturdiness, and price.  If you live on a fault line and want to mount your TV over a cabinet, you may want a tilting mount.",0,Negative
"Well overall it is a good product. The actual bracket is very well made and the locking feature engages and disengages very easily. However, VideoSecu needs to add more variety of lag screws and mounting screws. This product come with 5 lag screws? Also all the screws to mount the hooks on to the TV's are pretty much the same length so you are most likely going to need to use the spacers. I wouldn't have a problem with that until i realized when you use the spacers it makes it very difficult to mount the hook on the the mount because the screw sticks out too far. Luckily I had similar screws that were much shorter and i was able to fix the issue easily. The lag screws are way too short and you need to have an even amount of them (6). I have purchased this product more than a handful of times and it's the same thing every time. I use my own lag screws for the install and that works fine.So overall it is a good product but they definitely need to stop being so cheap on the screws and give more variety!!!",0,Negative
"I hung my Samsung 65&#34; using this mount whereas I don't need any tilt and I wanted something low profile. I didn't spend a considerable amount of money on a very thin TV just to secure it on a mount that makes it stick out off the wall. I have plenty of lag bolts in my shop, but I used the ones that came with the product. It has held the TV for over six months without concern. Please note that you must drill the PROPER diameter and depth pilot hole for the lag bolts. Granted they aren't Grade 8 bolts, but you can torque the head off almost any lag bolt if not properly installed. Absence of a pilot hole can also result in you splitting the stud in the wall by forcing a large bolt into it. You will also need a very long screw driver in order to secure the retainers behind the TV once placed on the mount.",0,Negative
"We purchased this wall mount for our 65&#34; Samsung LED tv.  When it came in this small box, I was concerned.  I thought, no way, this is not going to hold up our huge tv!

I might be worrying for nothing but I don't have the peace of mind that I need at this time.  I might end up changing it, maybe not. I am torn.",0,Negative
The vesa mounting screws were either too short or too long for my thin Samsung panel. They need to include more hardware variety.

"I was in need of a mount for my small 17"" LCD to put on the wall over a piano keyboard. A quick search and glance over the reviews and I was sold on this one. And at $20 with Supersaver this was an unbeatable deal.Well, I knew that all mounts are required to be anchored to a stud. What I didn't know is that for THIS model, you MUST have a stud in the wall exactly at the place where you'll fix your monitor. Otherwise you're out of luck. In my case, as it turned out, the monitor needs to rest exactly in between the 2 wall studs I located. The bad part is that it took me a while to figure it out because the included instructions are for a different model, which is 'articulated', showing the extended 'Arm-joints'. Man, I kept holding the bracket to the picture and it finally dawned on me that THIS model does not have any 'Arm-joints', which is exactly what I need. These would place the anchor on the stud and stretch flat against the wall, placing the monitor centered over my keyboard.A quick call to their customer support revealed that I can buy the add-on, the ""Level Mount Arm joint in Black"", Model ELAJ-MB for $16.99 + S&H.; X 2 because one alone won't do. Heck that's more than just buying a full new ""Level Mount DC30DJ Articulating"" here at Amazon. So I ended up with a useless piece of junk I can't return and that is not worth upgrading.",2,Negative
"Initially I was impressed with the strength of the mount. But having used it now for less than one year, the mount has failed.  There are two shafts that allow the articulating arms to move.  These shafts have threaded ends for lock nuts on the top and bottom of each shaft.  The problem is that the shafts are not long enough to reach the nylon part of the lock nut, and eventually the nuts will become detached from the shaft.  Although I noticed the articulating frame becoming loose before it dropped the TV, it was not fixable because the lock nuts are deep inside the articulating frame and cant be reached with even a thin wall socket.  Further, even if it could, the shaft itself is not long enough to stay locked with the lock nut.Because of this, I have re-written my review and I do not recommend.  I have since purchased another mount and I am extremely happy with it.",0,Negative
"I am appalled by the prices of lcd mounts are in big box stores.  This thing places the TV right against the wall, and is a breeze to install.

The instructions are thorough and even with limited skills, you should have no problem!",0,Negative
"Much cheaper than other mounts, and it works, but is unusually difficult to install. I had to re-bend part of the bracket, and tighten bolts on the swivel (required a hex wrench, not included). Also, the included level is useless, and it is hard to level the mounting plate using the included screws. Could have been better designed for mounting.Once installed, there is 3"" clearance between the back of the TV and the wall, which is necessary to allow swiveling and space for connections, unless you use angled coaxial and HDMI connectors.",0,Negative
"I used this to mount a 42 inch monitor the main problem was that the bracket was 1/2 inch too narrow; I improvised and separated the two wall brackets and used four toggle bolts for each side to secure each side to the wall, I would be nervous using this for more than a 42 inch monitor, for the price it does work.",2,Negative
"This is a VERY, VERY low end quality mount. First off, the mounting plate comes in 2 pieces. In my opinion, that makes the mount have a stress area right in the middle. The company does it to conserve/save on box size and packaging cost, but I feel it weakens the product. For the price (around $22) there are MUCH better mounts available that don't come in 2 pieces to patch together to mount on the wall.I did use the mount, I was only hanging a 40&#34; LCD TV that weighs 35 pounds. I WOULD NOT use this mount for anything larger than this. No way. I just didn't get a really great feeling on this whole mount/set up.I have used other brands (Sanus, Atlantic, etc) and those mounts are about same price, but much higher quality and the bracket comes as 1 piece (and thicker/heavier).",0,Negative
I needed a really little rack unit and this is just what the Dr. ordered.Well built and the side access panels are so convenient.I'm using this as a stand alone box (not mounted to the wall) so a back door option would have been nice but not a deal breaker.I also wish it had pre-threaded rack mounts vs. those stupid square insert nuts but what are you going to do. The price and size is right.,0,Negative
I bought several of these cabinets so I could lock up switches that were not secured as required for PCI compliance.  These  do exactly that and for a great price compared to similar cabinets. My only gripe with these were that some of the screws were already stripped making the removal of the mounting brackets difficult.  Also adjusting where the interior racks could be easier if they were on a sliding rail as opposed to complicated screws. But at around 125 each I can't do a lot of complaining.,0,Negative
"Compared to another wall mount I recently purchased, this wall mount is not very well designed.  Installation was pretty easy- drill the holes in the wall, attach the mount and then set the TV on the front. The problem is that the mount does not move in and out very easily.  This mount is designed to allow you to pull the TV away from the wall and push it back in, but it does not work like this.  Pushing and pulling the TV is difficult and not worth the effort. Additionally, the mount you set the TV on requires you to screw in tiny little tightening screws to keep the TV from wobbling.  Again, not very well designed.  I often find the TV is listing to one side and I have to manually adjust it about once a week.",0,Negative
"Pros:Great PriceArticulatingworks on 24"" studssolidCons:Difficult to level - The bubble it comes with isnt great.  Also, its difficult to level when you need to level from the where the mount attaches to the TV not where it attaches to the wall.  Eventually you can get it to level with constant fiddling.  Took me about 2 hours to get up and leveled properly.",0,Negative
"Pro:Very sturdy and heavy, so it should last a long time even with frequent pulling in and outLot's of screws for any mounting surface you might use.Dual arm extender prevent that sagging to one side that some people have complained about in other wall mountsCons:Cable management cover might come in damaged with a small ding, might be due to it being pre-installed in one of the arm.  Nothing like a few bangs with a hammer and wood block couldn't fix :)Holds up my Sony KDL-55HX729 w/o a hitch.  Was a pain in the behind to install by yourself since this monster is heavy to hold up on the wall with one hand.  But as long as you pre-drill your 2 top pilot holes in the studs, it shouldn't be too much problem.",1,Negative
"I installed a 47 inch LG TV on the wall with this.  I followed the instructions when I installed, and it installed quite easily.  Some people say it is a two person job, but I was able to do it myself.  It wasn't easy, but its possible.The downside, and the part that concerns me, is the stand seems to have a bit of a tilt to it.  The weight and size of the TV fit the specs for the mount.  But there is about a 7-10 degree tilt.  I haven't notice it get any worse, but I am still a bit worried about it.If it rips in half and breaks my TV, I will update my review.  Until then, it works!",0,Negative
"This wall mount does adequately fit our Sharp 60&#34; LCD TV. The manual could be more specific about how the assorted screws, bolts, washers, and spacers are to be fitted. I had to go through trial and error for placing some of the spacers and washers.The concrete anchors provided for the bolts seem like they would hold the mount to the wall, but I didn't have to attach the mount to concrete. I did attach it to drywall. There are screws/bolts that can go into the wall studs, but if you have 24 inches between stud centers, you would have to mount each edge to the studs. This may mean an off-centered TV. The drywall anchors just didn't look strong enough to hold into drywall.I've seen in forums that since you can pull the TV away from the wall with the articulating arms, there may be some sag in the unit. To counter that, I installed a half-inch board between the wall mount and the drywall to keep from indenting the drywall. I also used four butterfly anchors rated for about 250-pounds to ensure that unit will stay in place. I also used two screws directly into a wall stud to provide extra reinforcement. Even with the reinforced hardware and additions, the mount has a little sag to it.The vertical bars that attach directly to the TV can be angled down, but not up. I had to shim the bottom of the two bars to push the bottom of the TV out to angle it properly. Even with the shims, the TV is still slightly angled down (a couple of degrees). Also, the adjusting bolts at the top of the vertical bars that allow the TV to be angled down are hard to actually turn because of the clearance between the back of the TV and the attachment plate.I only pull the TV out when I need to get to the cables in the back of the TV. I run the wires between the TV and the vertical bars and bundle them with Velcro ties. To keep the wires from getting pinched from the articulating arms, I use two lose zip ties chained to each other. One loops around the bottom of an articulating arm while the other loops around the bundled cables.Despite the extra work I needed to do, I still give this TV wall mount 4 stars because of its price.",2,Negative
"Pros: It worksCons: Didn't come with the screws for my TV, came with a bunch of other screws for other TV sets but not my Sony Bravia 26"" HDTV KDL-M4000. I have to use my own screws until I can find a pair online somewhere.",2,Negative
This unit is for BIG TV's.  I found no problem mounting it or attaching my TV.  My TV is actually the smallest this mount will hold.  It is designed for 50-60 inch TV's.,2,Negative
Like others have said it is HEAVY! As long as you put it into the studs no issues. When I hooked my TV to it the bracket actually blocked the plug for the TV. Had to shimmy it around a little to work. Still not sitting right but it is on there strong so no worries. The adjustments for the tilt is so tight and have a weird design you have to almost set it for straight up and lock it before you hook the tv to the bracket. Small bad designs still didn't take away from it's function and price. Thumbs up.,0,Negative

"I bought one of these but not directly from VideoSecu. It did not come with instructions, so after first checking the VideoSecu website for a pdf version and finding nothing, I called them. The woman who answered the phone gave me a very difficult time about getting instructions, and would not send or email them to me because I didn't buy it directly from them. For this reason I can't recommend that anyone purchase their products; this is unforgivable customer service. Outside of that, the panel that mounts to the wall wall is only 19""W and the specs say it will accommodate 24"" studs.",0,Negative
too heavy and the second one I got is not aligning straight. I noticed it after fixing on the wall and my 65 inch TV tilts on one side.,0,Negative
Mine does not have the same tilt knob as the pictures on here.  It has this stupid lever that you can not adjust unless you take off the tv from the mount completely.  So there is no on the fly adjusting.  That's my only negative. I guess the other thing is that it's rather tight so you have to loosen the joint screws so you can articulate it easier.,0,Negative
"First, this isn't perfect. There is some droop in the hinges with my older (relatively heavy) 46&#34; TV. The way the TV rails mount to the unit also allow a bit of movement, hence more droop. So if you want the TV completely vertical, this will not work well.In my case, the TV is mounted above seated eye level, so the small droop is great as it tilts the TV slightly down, which I wanted anyway.The hinges are stiff. I imagine oil will fix that. It makes it difficult to position the TV.Wall mounting equipment is sufficient. However, whoever designed the TV rail mounting to the device should rethink it. There's no stop, so it's conceivable to slide the TV sideways off the mount. Not realistic, as it would be very hard, but theoretically possible. I believe most mounts work this way, though, so it's not like this is a problem unique to this device.Despite the several issues I've listed, I'm actually quite happy with it. It works well, is sturdy, inexpensive, and has no major issues.",0,Negative
"If you want a heavy duty mount that will do the job, this is it.  We originally had a heavy 42&#34; mounted on it and when that went bad we replaced it with a new 3d Samsung 40&#34; which weighs about 1/3 as much. It handeled both TV's with grace and poise.  If mounted correctly, your wall will probably fail before the mount does.Love the versatility of motion with this mount. It seems they though of almost everything with this mount. The swivel works even better with the new samsung TV that does not have the extra width of speakers built into the sides.",2,Negative
"The mount is great, we mounted it to the fireplace mantel so wall studs were not an issue. But the first screw's head broke off easily, so we used our own screws to mount it. I've seen this said several times, but forgot it, try to keep in mind that you'll want to get your own screws.",0,Negative
I can't comment on ease of installing as I was not present when it was mounted but I can say it will put a flat screen at any angle you want it just about. I specifically needed a mount that would adjust tilt left and right as a door way blocked the center of the only usable wall for a large TV for my parents. This mount allowed the TV to look back to the center of the room and eliminate sharp viewing angles. Simple UP-Down tilt would have done no good with this problem.,2,Negative
"This mount is much heavier than the TV itself.  I installed it all by my lonesome, but it is a bit awkward as the frame weighs quite a bit.I would echo another review and advise purchasers to get their own wood screws at the local hardware store.  The screws supplied with the unit are ""lag bolts"" and not terribly easy to screw into the wall studs.  You can pick them up while waiting for delivery.I would definitely buy this unit again.",0,Negative
"this tv wall mount is very strong...I mounted my 65'' vizio led on the wall...i did go all the way thru my concrete wall with long lag bolt i only use the two middle hole of the wall mount ..then i used concrete screw 1/4'' one on each corner of the wall mount,,YOU COULD HANG AN ELEPHANT ON THIS MOUNT.",0,Negative
"Pretty easy to install. The biggest problem is finding the studs. Even with the stud finder I drilled a lot of extra holes. No big deal though, because they will all be covered by the mount when it is hung. The mount is very heavy and solid - I have no worries about it holding a heavy TV. I did get the thicker lag screws as others recommended. Don't be frightened by the amount of bolts and spacers in the package - you won't need half of them.",0,Negative
Heavy and Sturdy mount just like much more expensive items at local stores.  Works well with studs spaced on 24 inch centers.  Due to the weight and possible distance from the wall it should be mounted into wall studs.  Comes with screws and bolts needed for mounting in most situations.  If you have 1 inch drywall you may want to use longer lag screws than those provided.,2,Negative
"First thing that usually catches my attention are spandex/lycra shorts, haha. OK besides that, it's the ratings for a product. When I saw this was 4.5 out of 5, I looked at it more closely and read many of the reviews. After a day of thinking and shopping for it retail stores, I purchased it. Similar products of articulating arms cost around $100-$300. This one cost $75 at the time of purchase so I had some doubts that it was a quality product.Upon receiving the box, the box was packed well and it had basic instructions. All screws, bolts, and nuts seem to be there. I dont recommend that anyone attempt to mount tvs. You must have some skill, know how to use a stud sensor and know the basics of screws, wall material, etc. In fact, my 2 guy buddies tried to mount tvs and failed. Now they have numerous holes in the wall and they bought a tv stand. lol. They are no handy men at all. Anyhow, I had no problem mounting (mounted 6 tvs) it on my Sony 55HX800 3D tv. It's a solid mount with thick solid steel double arms. The tv stays in place where u move it. It pulls out 20"" from the wall which I like because that makes the TV bigger than it is. When it's not in use, I push it back towards the wall.Like everyone here, I highly recommend this mount. I would definitely buy another in the future.",0,Negative
"Confirmed working on a Panasonic Viera 42"" TC-P42UX-1This is very sturdy, feels like it can hold larger TVs with no effort.  I mounted mine on concrete wall, no problems.  I recommend having a 3/8"" drill bit for mounting the base.Instructions could be better.  Bolts and screws were labeled wrong relative to manual and I had to figure out where everything was supposed to go. Perhaps manufacturer could include spanish instruction manual?",2,Negative
"This wall mount works great, it holds my 32 inch TV  fine.  The problem I had was finding out that the studs in my wall are 24 inches apart.  The mount has holes 24 inches apart on the very end, but the screws provided have hexagonal heads that are too big to be able to screw them in all the way, since the screw will be rubbing against the side of the mount, not to mention the holes are so close to the edges that there is no way to fit a washer on the screw.  I ended up using my own screws that were small enough that I could screw them in all the way without rubbing against the side of the mount.I give it 4 stars since most homes won't have this problem, but I do find it ridiculous that they would include holes for 24 inch studs and not add an extra centimeter on each side to allow you to use them.",0,Negative
Our TV is at the larger end of the size range so the mounting was not that easy but it does the job.,4,Negative
While this mount worked for my 46&#34; LED tv its easy to spot the reason why its so cheap. It only hooks on the top bracket. No hooks on the bottom bracket. Instead you have a screw that you turn that screws upward and behind the bottom bracket. You cant screw it all the way up because the bracket that holds the screw starts bending out of shape.So what ends up happening is if you pull the bottom of the TV forward it will move forward off the wall until the bottom screws hit the bottom bracket. Thats what stops it from comming off the wall. My other Mount that cost $50 has hooks for both top and bottom and has security screws. It does not budge at all when you move it. This one only has top hooks and bottom security screws.The whole thing feels a little flimsy but it does the job. I would definatley not trust this for anything larger than 50&#34; or anything that weighs more than 50 pounds. If you just dont want to pay the extra few bucks then this mount will still work for you. Just know taht you get what you pay for and things are cheap for a reason.,0,Negative
"I would have given it a 5 but for some reason they decided to ship these unassembled, I have bought about 20 of these in the past and they were assembled, no problem just seems to be going backwards.",3,Negative
"The price on this is so much better than other stores, and it works sturdily for me.  I ran into trouble getting the mount points centered on the studs when they were 24&#34; apart rather than 16&#34;, but it still (barely) worked for me.  Yes, you can avoid that issue by getting an arm articulated stand, but I much prefer the lower profile of this mount to the arm variety.  Especially as the TV mount is visible from the side when entering the room its mounted in.",0,Negative
"Get this. Seriously why pay $100+ at the store for these?! I have three so far in my house and they work just fine. I have a 32&#34;, 42&#34;, and a 55&#34; tv. Samsung, and vizio brands.",0,Negative
"I was a little confused when I opened the box, but just followed the instructions and everything was fine.Great price too!!!",4,Negative
"Kinda worried it would not fit the big tv when i got this out of the box, but it comes in two parts you screw together.",4,Negative
"Includes an array of different screws for mounting into the back of your TV, which was a nice unexpected benefit. Word of warning when mounting to the wall - DO NOT try to use the screw holes nearest to the left or right sides. They are blocked by the edges which makes it really difficult to screw it all the way in!",2,Negative
"So, wall studs are supposed to be 16&#34; on center. Each of the metal rectangle mounts are 12&#34;. This gives you 24&#34;. This is not a big deal unless the center of the position the tv is to be hung is the stud. This means you will have one stud for the screws. I had to buy another one of these to cannibalize another bracket to reach the other studs needed to hang my 55&#34; TV. Just be aware you may be buying 2 of these. They are cheap though, so it was not a huge deal.",2,Negative
"Was looking for a cheap wall mount. I didn't want to spend as much money as I paid for my first wall mount. This unit works but hanging the TV was not as easy as my other wall mount that cost a little more. So you are sacrificing a little functionality with this cheaper unit. The unit puts your TV flush to the wall and it is hard to get behind the TV and connect your components as well as tightening your TV down. My other mount was just like hanging a picture frame, but this one is a lot more difficult. But it does do the job.",2,Negative
"I originally placed this in my cart because it was much cheaper than another, very similar item.  Once I saw how pricing shipping was, the price difference slimmed down to about a dollar, but both items had high reviews, and this one had the level built into the unit so one less tool to organize or lose.  I discovered later that the other model has an internal and external level, so no real issue there.  In the end, it was the installation instructions and parts that cause me to give this a less than stellar review.  The instructions don't do a good job of identifying which part is which, you get more types of parts than you need, and in the end, I had to use a totally different part than what the instructions suggest, requiring an eMail conversation with the manufacturer.  I never ended up using it for other reasons, sold it for about what I paid, and it might be no better than the other brand, but when I buy a replacement in a week, I'll get the other brand because of the installation issues.",0,Negative

"Once I mounted my TV on the wall there was very little room between the back of the TV and the wall.  Depending on where your HDMI, audio, etc., connections are on your TV, it could be difficult to add cables, etc. without first removing the TV from the wall.  Otherwise, there is no reason to pay the inflated prices for a similar mount from a local retailer.  The mount is very sturdy and all of the hardware I needed to install the wall mount bracket on the wall, and my TV to the bracket, was included, including 2"" lag bolts.  An excellent product.",0,Negative
Needed this to mount a 32&#34; in my spare room up high and it needed to tilt down.  This item did just that and it is seated well very close to the wall.  No regrets!,3,Negative
I have both this and the cheetah mount.  This product was easy to put together and very sturdy.  I have a 55 inch led on it now but I know it can handle much more weight than that.  The only knock is that it is not as slim as the Cheetah mount.  It comes out about 3-4 inches away from the wall.  The Cheetah mount is a bit flimsier and required more screws to put it in place.,4,Negative
"Bought this bracket for my 46"" plasma TV.  I was afraid of the quality based on the price but my fear was quickly eliminated right out of the box.  It is sturdy and well made.  You will not need to look elsewhere as this is the right bracket for the purpose.  Makes you wonder what the other brands are charging you for.  It's not like I saw one made of titanium!?",4,Negative
"It was not Wide enough for a standard 50"" Panasonic Plasma.  Only 3 of the 4 hooks actually hook on the metal based on a std. width 50"" Plasma Television.  I found this ridiculous when it claims to be able to fit up to 65"" televisions.  I could not in all honesty, recommend this product (and I bought 2 of them - 1 for a 50 and 1 for a 58"".  Also, compared to other brackets I've purchased on Amazon in the past, this particular one has thinner metal (cheap in my opinion).  If you are spending in excess of 1k on a tv, don't make the mistake and get this bracket.  I bought into the number of high reviews, and the fact it has built in level is nice, but it doesn't make up for the misrepresentation and thin metal.",0,Negative
"Just installed a Smart Tv 32&#34; on this.  It was a new wall that I created, but I failed to plan on one thing.  I had an access cut for wires in the wall, but in my planning, I was centering the size of the TV, by way of a cardboard template.  Unfortunately, the wall mount brackets don't sit center on the back of the Samsung TV, so it ended up mounting higher on the wall than I had planned.  This should be noted in the instructions for mounting.  My bad. But it does tilt, so it will work.  Also, the two pieces of the part that mounts to the wall bolt together with a slight bend that will flatten out when you bolt them to the wall. It is concerning when trying to get it level. Take your time and level as you tighten bolts. Did not need to use the extenders on the bottom, because it would make the brackets sit up above the TV and would be visible.  Was surprised at how far it sits out from the wall, but we did want the tilting option.  If you want something flat against wall, go for the low profile, it will be harder to fish wires and won't have the tilting option.  Hope this helps.",2,Negative
"I bought this to mount my new 32"" Samsung which weighs just 18.6 pounds.  I was amazed how small the package was.  I took it out and realized why, the frame comes in 2 pieces and is held together by screws in the middle.  I am not a fan of the 2 piece design but I was willing to give it a shot.  The Cheetah version of this product has a small metal piece to hold the two pieces together.  This product uses only 4 very small screws and washers.  Again, I kept pushing and tried to mount.  The mount is 25"" across but none of the holes line up with 24"" studs.  Most new construction (and some old) have 24"" centers on non-load bearing walls.  This product cannot be used for those without serious modification.  Some other reviewers have said they drilled additional holes for 24"" studs but I did not.  This was such a flimsy product to start with I was not comfortable reducing the integrity even further.I probably would have been comfortable hanging my 18 pound TV on this one but you would be crazy to mount a 100 pound TV on this and thats below the maximum rating!  Stay away.  For the same money you can get the Cheetah mount.  It is also a bit flimsy but it is way better than this.Don't buy just because its cheap.  Remember how much you paid for the TV and weigh that against how well it will bounce if this breaks.",0,Negative
"The base is two pieces that connect in the middle with screws. Once connected, it isn't straight when looking down on it, so it doesn't line up properly with the wall. It's fine otherwise.",2,Negative
"This mount was advertised with a list price of $139.95, so I expected a sturdy product.  The package that arrived was only 13&#34; long, and I thought I was shipped the wrong product.  After opening the package, I discovered that the wall bracket must be assembled before affixing to the wall.  I have purchased $150.00 wall mounts in the past, and they feature one solid wall mount, the metal guage is much thicker, and the TV brackets are much more substantial than this unit.  Quite frankly, I would feel very uncomfortable mounting a $1500.00 - 60&#34; TV using this product.  It would be OK for a very small TV however.  This product is advertised with an inflated list price, and I am returning it and purchasing a legitimate $150.00 mount - The bottom line for this (and any other) purchase is &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.....",4,Negative
"I run a 1 man AV install business. Used plenty of this manufacturers products and have been satisfied.

"Although this is supposed to be a universal mount, be careful. This didn't work on my older Panasonic Th-42PX60U as the back was too curved.

"For the price, you can't beat this wall mount. No it doesn't swivel, but it does tilt and can be locked into a tilted position. I mounted this on my bedroom wall and hung a 42&#34; Samsung TV on it with no problems. I did use my own level as the provided one is junk, but it does comes with all the hardware (screws/bolts/nuts) you will need to install. As for tools, you will need a drill, a stud finder, and as I already stated- a decent level. Hanging the TV would always be easier with two people, but I did it by myself no problem.Just remember, measure twice, cut (or in this case drill) once.Pros:- Price (compared to big box stores)- Quality (same quality as wall mounts costing 3 times as much)- Ease of use (installed in 20 minutes by myself)- Comes with lots of mounting solutions depending on the type of wall you are mounting it on- Free HDMI cable - can't beat that!Cons:- Cheap level (don't use the included level, use a quality one)- Not the best instructions (not really needed however)Definitely recommended for anyone looking to wall mount their TV, and not looking to spend a fortune doing it.",4,Negative

No worries.Instructions were a little vague,  and some of the hardware is poorly marked, but we muddled through.Having a stud finder is a must!!! cannot stress that enough. Drilling pilot holes for the lag bolts is also a must! Do NOT just drive the lag bolts into your wall without a pilot hole!!Great little product.",0,Negative
"This mount was a breeze to install.  Took me maybe 30 minutes from start to finish.  And that included running the cables and hooking them back up.  I would recommend a stud finder if you arent that good with DIY stuff.  The built in level and the plastic one that came with the kit are junk.  I tried both levels, and for one, neither of them would show level at the same time.  And then i put my regular craftsman level on there and both of the levels in the kit were off.No big deal.  Just use your own level.  The bolts that came with the kit were heavy duty and strong.  The hardware kit had bolts in there for every tv in my house.  Lg, Vizio, Sanyo.  I haven't tried this HDMI cable yet, but the other mount I purchased had a very low quality HDMI cable in it.  So I'm guessing this one is probably the same.Amazon has a good price on Mediabridge HDMI cables.  Pick you up one of those instead for an extra $10.Assembly was a breeze.  This kit came is 6 pieces.  Top, Bottom, 2 sides, 2 front panels.  You attach the sides with simple screws and once they are on, this thing is sturdy.I would recommend this mount for any size TV.

"Look..... it works just fine and once you deduct the cost of an HDMI cable,it doesn't cost more than it's weight in scrap metal!It's a little crude but my biggest problem with it is that it is very difficult to screw in the safety lock screws from underneath and also there are no knobs on the tilt adjustment so you have to use a socket with a long extension.This mount needs a lot of space either side and underneath.VideoSecu....Make it a few bucks more but make it more user friendly!!",0,Negative
"The included level and HDMI cable are handy. I have 20 HDMI cables sitting around the house so I wasn't really concerned with the free cable. But It never hurts to have an extra cable I guess. The cable is pretty thick, not like super cheap HDMI cables you pick up for $1-2 online.The mount itself comes with different size screws for mounting to your TV. It's annoying that while the VESA standard dictates exactly WHERE holes for mounting your TV should be placed, but not the length and thread type of the mounting screws.My TV used one of the smallest screws included, which were unfortunately too long to be tightened completely. I picked up a couple of small washers from the local hardware store (the thick washers that are included were too large, and would not allow the screws to reach the TV) and everything worked fine. I eventually got a newer TV and the screws that fit that particular TV worked fine without any additional hardware.I don't really see this as a negative, with the large number of brands and models it would probably be impossible to include every possible size and length of screw to fit every TV ever made.The bracket itself consists of two halves which are bolted together. It seems sturdy enough but I did notice that when I bolted the halves together, they were not completely flat with each other. I mounted the bracket to studs, but I worry that if I used this with sheetrock and the included anchors, that the slight bend of the two halves might put extra strain on my wall.The tilt is not easily adjustable on the fly, don't expect to be able to constantly change the tilt if you need to. You have to loosen two bolts on each side, adjust the TV and then tighten them. If you just need to set the TV to be tiled at one angle permanently (as I did), it works fine and it won't accidentally change if you bump into it.Overall this is a pretty great mount for the price.",2,Negative

"The back plate installed easily across two studs. In this case the studs were on each side of center, however, the back plate would have fit over two offset studs (assuming, of course, that the studs were a standard 16-inches apart.) after attaching the bars on the back of the TV, two persons lifted the 145 lb. TV and mounted it quickly onto the back plate, adjusted the tilt, and then locked the setting without any other tools.It also came with a high-speed HDMI cable and a bubble level. An assortment of metric screws for attaching the back plates, to most any TV, were also included. The only change I made to the installation, was to supply bigger (5/16"") lag screws, because of the TV weight. The mounting holes in the back plate accommodated the bigger lags without enlarging the holes.The only disadvantage to the wall mount, is that one cannot get to some of the inputs once the TV is mounted to the wall. I recommend attaching all of the cables, even if you don't know if you'll be using them, before lifting the TV onto the mount: HDMI, optical cable, DVD composite, LAN, etc.",2,Negative

"I was a little worried at first, because I live in a high rise, so the studs are metal studs, and couldn't really use the wood stud parts on the metal studs.  Instead of putting using 1 stud, I mounted both disks on the drywall and works great!  Very easy to install, TV hands flush against the wall, making the TV look more like a piece of art, rather than a TV.  Definitely would recommend this.  Only thing that I don't understand is the kick stand it comes from, its too long, that you can't push the TV out enough for it to hold it out from the wall (in order to plug in cables?).

We set this up in my son's room and added shelving below to hold a DVD stereo that he attaches to the TV. So I wish it tilted downwards a bit more but it works and he like it.

You will need the following:  stud finder, ruler, level, drill 3/16, and finishing nails.  The finishing nails are optional, but I used them to level the mounting panel and mark the exact holes for the pilot drilling.

"After shopping around, I selected this model wall mount.  It is very sturdy!  Have also put up at our son's house on their 50&#34; tv, ours is 46&#34;.  Only thing I wasn't totally impressed with is the wall anchors.  The style that is supplied is suitable for a cinder block or concrete wall, but not so hot for drywall.  I go to Menard's and get some decent wall anchors designed for drywall, and that does the trick.  Oh, we also used a laser level for alignment on the wall, and that was really slick!  Not sure about the built in level.",1,Negative
First this mount is really built and function very smooth both side to side and up and down.  But.... Mounting it with the use of the build-in level was a mistake.  The built-in level is 5 to 10 degrees off which makes your TV off.  We used my own level to mark the wall before we drilled the mounting holes.  Always checked twice and drill once.  It has plenty of holes.  The hardware comes in a picket belt.  The screws did match with the flat washers and star washers.  Not a big deal.  TV was a snap to hang and tighten.Was able to hang on it will my body weight.  So it should hold the 50&#34; Sony TV with no problem.,0,Negative
"I bought this for my neighbor's new 60&#34; HDTV. The mount has plenty of options for mounting on off-centered studs; as was the case in my neighbor's house. The main issue that we have with this mount is the tendency for the arms to collapse inward, instead of outward, after the TV has been pulled out as far as possible. A secondary issue is it would be nice for additional cable management options but for the price, it probably can't be beat.",2,Negative
"Do you have a stud finder? A tape measure? Go check the wall you want to mount your tv on and find out how far apart on center your studs are, then come back... I'll wait...Got that info? Ok, keep reading.The mount itself is exceedingly well made. It's very solid in constructions and heavy as all heck, having Amazon Prime saved a ton on shipping. Therein, however, lies my problem. I received the mount after looking for one that would support my 48inch Samsung and decided to go with overkill for making sure it stays on the wall and doesn't drop. I receive it and had planned to get it mounted this weekend. TV is pulled out away from the wall along with it's stand, cables moved around, area cleaned, brackets put on back of the TV to hold it. Studs in the wall are located and their centers found. Then I go to mount the plate against the wall only to find that the plate is too short! My studs are 24inch on center apparently and this mount WILL NOT work with 24inch on center studs. Mount-IT! does sell one that works with studs set that far apart and I did order that one, however I'm stuck with this mount as it would be prohibitively expensive to send it back for what I paid for it due to shipping. No where in the description did it say it WOULD NOT WORK with 24inch on center stud walls.The only fault with the product is the description needs to be more clear so I can't really take more than two stars off. Not every one is going to think to measure how far apart their studs are BEFORE purchasing this. Live and learn, but sometimes mistakes are expensive.Moral of this story is measure. Then measure again.",2,Negative
"Does it do its job? Yes. It holds my 55&#34; Samsung TV without a problem, but my 55&#34; also only weights like 50-60 lbs, so that's not much of an achievement for a mount.first issue I encountered, the provided bolts did NOT fit my samsung tv.  My samsung tv required M8 25mm bolts, it came with 16mm and 40mm.  So, if you're buying a new samsung tv, be advised, you'll need to pick up 25mm bolts, granted its just a few dollars, but be prepared for the extra trouble.Next, while not expecting great engineering, and knowing that when fully collapsed, it's roughly 6.5&#34; from the wall, it could have been a lot LOT closer to the wall, so that's a bit unfortunate for me.Installation wasn't super easy, as I needed someone else to help me mark holes and screw in the screws into the wall while I held the mount, which is definitely quite hefty.However, having said all this, the mount extends nicely, i havent encountered any issues with it catching or snagging, and all in all, works as described.Last note, I contacted Mount-it!, and they have terrible customer service.  They basically only sell the darn things.  No customer support from there on out.  Even though this is a &#34;SAMSUNG compatible&#34;, they didnt include the correct size screws and would not send me new ones either.  Not such a great company in my opinion.",0,Negative
"This was a VERY durable mount for the price.  Nothing was cheap on it.  I used my 46"" LCD to mount.  Which probably only weighs around 50 lbs.  I don't know what a tv that is near the max weight would hang like.  But I have no fears of mine hanging.",0,Negative
"This seems to be a good mount, however, the included hardware is low quality. I had two of the included lag screws break after they were screwed in 90% of the way (with properly drilled pilot holes). I went to the hardware store and bought the same size lag screws made of higher quality steel for$.45 a piece and the problem was solved.The included m6 screws were also too long for my TV which required another additional purchase.",0,Negative

"This product is GREAT!!! Man talk about sturdy construction!My only gripe with this as other reviews have said the bolts supplied with this kit are just plain bad.During my installation I thought to myself.... &#34;Hrmm, they look fine.....and man I don't want to drive out to the hardware store, let give this a go!&#34; 20 minutes later I have a metal bolt stuck buried in my wall and the head sitting in my hand. That is what I get for not listening to previous reviewers. a metal bolt stuck in the wall and 3 other holes 2 inches below where I had to reposition the mount to.LISTEN AND LEARN! don't use the supplied bolts.Now after I have successfully installed it and mounted my TV to it I have nothing but awesome things to say about it. Side to side, tilting, out and in, right and left. all day long. This thing was built to last.Great mount!",0,Negative
"I am having a bit of a hard time writing this review because I really don't have anything negative to say.Everything worked as intended, I had no problems at all mounting the mount or hanging the TV.I did use stainless steel bolts instead of the ones provided, not sure if that made a difference or not.One thing worth mentioning is that the mount is very heavy, my girlfriend could not lift it easily and mounting it is certainly a two man job.",0,Negative
"The mount, as reviewed by others, is a bargain at the price.  Other reviews mentioned the quality of the included lag bolts.  This problem, if it ever was one, appears to have been corrected and I have no complaints with the quality of the included bolts/screws, or other hardware.  The unit is very high quality, the fit/finish appears to be first rate, and the unit scissors in/out and swivels very smoothly.  You can pay more, but I can't see what you'd gain by it.  (Except maybe a template, which I'll discuss below.)The unit will only work with 16"" on-center studs.  Do not get this unit if that isn't the construction standard in your home.  This is already mentioned in several other reviews.The biggest negative about this unit is that it does NOT/NOT include a wall template.  This means that all wall marking must be done with this unit held several feet above ground.  Since the unit is quite heavy, this is a challenge under the best of circumstances.  If you are doing the prep work alone, it makes the task a daunting one.  My suggestion is to take a blank piece of construction paper, or other suitable material, and spend the time/effort to make a wall template prior to beginning installation.  Then take some blue painter's tape to hold the template on the wall.  This will make it easier to pre-drill the holes, and the painter's tape won't mark up your walls.  That was the only way I got this accomplished.Lastly, one review mentioned some other wall anchors.  ([..]  I bought them and they work as advertised.  I'm keeping them and will use them on other projects as they are light years ahead of traditional toggle bolts.  However, your drywall may fail even if the anchors do not.  (The anchors will hold, but end up pulling a 2' circle of drywall down when the tv overpowers the drywall.)  Unless your TV is LCD and/or not very heavy, do NOT/NOT attempt to mount the unit using anything other than lag bolts secured into the studs.  My TV is a 58"" plasma tipping the scales at 125 lbs, and the drywall anchors held, but were not as secure as I was comfortable with.  I ended up taking down the whole thing and using the lag bolts.  The drywall anchors did make it easier to hold the unit on the wall while I was securing the lags, but no way was I going to leave the unit up absent proper lag bolts.Update - The unit has been hanging well over a week with no problems.  I would not hesitate to purchase this mount again.",2,Negative
"This articulating wall mount was easy to install and the instructions were quite clear.  Measure & drill 4 holes, making sure to hit the studs.  Use a socket wrench to put in the lag bolts to hold it up.  Install the hooks to the back of your TV and hook it onto the wall mount.  Done!  The only hard part about the installation was the mount was very heavy.  I did it myself by resting the wall mount's arms on my shoulder while I secured the lag bolts.  I give it 4.5 stars and not 5 because the mount itself was not aligned perfectly (level) with the wall plate.  The mount is adjustable but I feel that if it's a brand new product, it should come perfectly aligned from the factory.  I had to spend extra time to make sure it was perfectly level before I hung my TV.  If I needed another mount, I would buy this product again!",0,Negative
"I got this mount mega cheap after seeing a sale on it.  it was $60 after S&H compared to the $200 or so regularly.  It is an extremely heavy duty mount and its overkill for my 42"" tv but i have had no issues with it other than trying to hang it by myself because its big and heavy.",4,Negative
"This thing is a monster and weighs a TON! It didn't fit the bolt pattern on my Sony 32&#34; TV... I suppose that is my fault.  If you're mounting a 65&#34; console TV, I have no doubt this would hold it... the studs might rip out though.",2,Negative
This mount is a poorly engineered piece of junk. I'm a contractor and I mounted it plumb and level on a flat 2 x 6. As it rotates the TV becomes un-level. Rotating it 6&#34; drops the puts the TV out of level by and inch. This occurs because the mount pole wasn't welded perpendicular to the flange that rotates on the ceiling bracket. The company's quality control during assembly stinks.,0,Negative

"It is well built and very stable. whichIt is not easy move a 100# 70&#34; TV in or out, due to the TV's lack of grippable structure and size  which masks access to the mount.It does its job well.The built in level is nice but not worth a lot, because the mount-to-TV interface is adjustable in the horizontal (roll) position, even if wall to mount angle is off.Even though I'd been warned, about the mount's weight, by previous reviewers, I was surprised watching the UPS man struggle to get the package up to his shoulder.",2,Negative

"This is the best mounting bracket I've ever used on a TV.  It's very high quality and very sturdy.  If you have a VERY heavy TV like I do (mine is nearly 100 lbs) the only suggestion I would make is to put a piece of plywood between the mounting bracket and your wall, so you can not only mount it to studs but use some heavy duty drywall anchors to anchor the wood against the wall and give it extra stability.  Otherwise your wall may collapse long before this mounting bracket shows any signs of weakness.",2,Negative

"This is a very heavy gauge mount. It is quite heavy so plan on it being a two person job to mount due to the fact that the wall mount with accordian swing out bracket is all assembled. The hardware provided will fit just about any TV and instructions are adequate. I stongly suggest you hit the studs with the bolts although they provide very large plaster wall anchors if you can't. It does not mention where the knobs provided go. Use the carraige bolts and insert them on the brackets attached to the TV (you will see there are square holes to accomidate these). They are hand tightened when you set your tilt angle where you want it. Have never seen a mount this heavy gauge but, if installed correctly, you will have no worries.",2,Negative

"I purchased this mount because I wanted to mount my Samsung 63""Samsung PN63C8000 63-Inch 1080p 3D Plasma HDTV, Blackas close to the wall as possible, and this seemed to be the lowest mount available with the exception of the Samsung picture frame style mount, but that mount was over $200 and I had qualms about the stability of that mount (just mounts into the drywall - no thanks).I had read some of the negative reviews about this ultra low profile mount where users had a problem with having room for wires.  On my Samsung, the inputs are oriented towards the side of the TV, so I figured I'd have plenty of room for wires.Installation wasn't too difficult, but the included instructions were pretty bad.  I didn't find out until after installing that they have a video instruction on the Sanus website - I highly recommend viewing before installation.  One thing to make sure you do before mounting the TV, is make sure you adjust the strings behind the TV so they hang down low enough (almost as low as the bottom of the TV) that you can reach them.  You will need to pull these strings to make adjustments, plug in your inputs, or remove the mount later - so neglecting to adjust the strings prior to mounting, as I did on my first pass, can leave a major headache (I was able to fish them from behind the TV, and I removed the TV from the mount and adjusted the wires correctly and remounted ... again, had I watched the video I wouldn't have made this mistake in the first place).So why 3 stars?  Well I have a couple of problems with this mount.  The bracket that attaches to the TV grips the top of the wall mount, then is supposed to ""click"" into place at the bottom in order to form a secure mount.  Problem is, if there is anything back there at all blocking the TV, it won't click into place.  This is the problem some of the negative reviewers who have TVs with inputs facing backwards have - it didn't leave any room for the HDMI or other input cables.  In my case, my cables are perpendicular to the TV and don't seem to be the problem.  What's even worse than the lack of clicking, is my TV isn't quite flat against the wall - the front of the TV is a little under 2"" from the wall on the left side, and a little over 2"" from the wall on the right side, for a difference of over half an inch.  I think my culprit might be, the wall I have it mounted on is in a spot where an exterior concrete block wall meets an interior wall, with a sheet of drywall over the interior and the drywall has a very very slight (barely noticeable, and in fact not noticeable at all had I never tried to mount this to it) bulge to it.  I think that very slight roundness is what is causing my problems with this mount.  Yes, I realize this is mostly my own problem as I don't have a perfectly smooth mounting surface - but my point is, this ""ultra slim"" mount by leaving only .55"" inches behind the TV leaves you almost no room for error.  If there is any obstruction, including wires or anything else, you could have problems.Other than that, the quality of this product is pretty good.  The one week spot I would point out, and I haven't tested it for failure, but the mechanism where you pull the strings to release the lock seems pretty flimsy.  If this mechanism were to fail, you would potentially find it extremely difficult to remove the TV from the wall.  And again, with the extremely low profile of the mount at only .55"", you'd have very few options to get back there and try to get the thing loose.Overall, this isn't a terrible product, but I have to recommend it with reservations.  If, like most TVs, the inputs on your TV face backwards requiring some room for wires, I would look for a mount that isn't quite so close to the wall.  Similarly, if your wall is anything but perfectly flat and smooth (get up with your eye next to your wall and look, the imperfection I'm talking about is not noticeable otherwise), this mount could give you problems.  On top of that, the flimsy string mechanism would worry me a little bit as well.  Finally, if your setup can accommodate an ultra low profile mount and you do decide to buy this product, make sure to watch the installation video on the Sanus website, and if installing into concrete, I'd go out and buy better anchors than what comes with this mount.3 Stars.  Under perfect conditions it probably works fine and it does get the TV nice and close to the wall, but frankly I wish I'd just bought a less low profile mount to start with - it would end up looking just as good with much less hassle.  I will probably replace this mount with one that has a little more forgiveness, likely one of the cheaper Amazon Basics models that get good reviews.",2,Negative
"I used this to install a 70&#34; Sony TV.  Installation was simple and they give you a ton of screws and adaptors for various TV brands.  I only gave it 4 stars because it is a little flimsy.

I ordered this based not the hight reviews from other Amazon users and i was note disappointed. I used the supplied low profile lag bolts to secure to in wall studs. I did not have issues with the hardware provided or the length of the release ropes (these are pulled to allow the TV to be tilted for cable attachment). I am using this mount with a 105lb Vizio 70&#34; and only had on concern...the concern I had was I needed to buy some 1.25&#34; screw to attach the TV to the brackets because the ones supplied were either too long or two short.

I already had it home for almost 2 months I couldn't be happier with my decision.Pros:-Fair price-Great size-3D ready-Good picture and adjustment settings-Light Weight-Good SoundCons:-Bad viewing angles-When connected to a PC, overscan will make you reduce the display format, or crop the resolution to fit the image-3D mode doesn't support windowed mode, which doesn't allow you to reduce the display format to run the 1080p when connected to a PC, so you'll be forced to crop the resolution if planning to run 3d with the Nvidia 3D Vision.Other thoughts:-If you heard about a greenish/bluish tinge when turning the 3D mode on, it does happens, but when the glasses are active and you're running 3d content all you see is real black. At least that's how it works with my nvidia glasses.-Overscan issue forces you to crop your PC resolution when activating the 3D, in my case I'm using 1834x1034p, still is High Definition but not all games support custom formats, so you'll end up playing those at smaller resolutions if you want to use the 3D. Anyway, I don't think you'll have a problem with custom formats with the latest games.",2,Negative
"These is holding up my 65&#34; Samsung series 8 TV.  It was easy to install and has an extremely low profile when pushed all the way against the wall.  I would buy another one of these in a heartbeat.  Very sturdy and smooth to operate, I had no problem paying a little extra for a well made item.",4,Negative
I paired this with a 55 samsung and none of the mounting bolt combinations would work so I had to cut the long bolts down. Then the tilt would not hold so I had to brace it with more hardware. There is way more heavy hardware than is needed to hang a TV. Its crap.,2,Negative
"The product is very high quality, and very sturdy.  It has lots of adjustments, which I needed to precisely position my new 60"" TV over the hole in the cabinet from my older TV.  I wish the up down positioning had greater range.  It seemed to only move less than 1"".  I should have purchased the 1 arm model since with 2 arms, one arm conflicts with all the cables.  I guess the 1 arm design would not have this problem.  The 2 arms made getting the TV close to the wall more difficult.",2,Negative
"I purchased this mount for my 32"" LCD with 400 x 200 vesa mounting pattern. Everything was packaged nicely and there were no missing parts. When installing the brace on the wall I used a level to make sure it was straight. I noticed after attaching the TV that it was not level at all. I checked the brace again on the wall and it was still fine. Was able to finally get it pretty much perfectly level by lifting up the lower side of the TV and tightening the bolts that lock the forward tilting. Overall it does what it is supposed to, but for me was kind of a pain to get it level.",0,Negative
Heavy contruction. Should have been easy to install but the holes didn't line up properly on the swing arms making it extremely difficult to get the pins in.If I hadn't had a vise & small bar to align holes I would have sent it back. However I finally got it installed & working fine.,2,Negative
"I've been using this product for over a year now without incidence. It's sturdy and holds firm against the wall and the metal shows no signs of bending/warping. For the price, this was a very good purchase. I believe some people have complained about the ""lack of instructions"" and while it was over a year ago that I installed it, I don't recall it being difficult to install. In fact, I think my exact thought at the time was, ""Wow! Some people must be really incompetent if they can't figure this out!"" In all seriousness though, this wall mount can't be beat at this price.",4,Negative
"Let me start this review with the following background info... I installed a rather medium weight 40&#34; Westinghouse LCD on this mount in my billiards room. This was the third wall mount I personally own and the 5th total I have installed. It was by FAR the worst in all possible ways.Metal parts of this mount are lightweight and not good quality at all. It took MUCH longer to install this mount than all I have previously done. This was mainly because of how many pieces/parts are included. The style of it was the main reaason for that, of which I am NOT a fan. Lag bolts included were USELESS as they stripped instantly... I ended up getting some better ones from Home Depot.This was personally my first dual arm mount and will be my very last. I'm sticking with fixed position. I did install a 46&#34; LCD on one for my father that was a Sanus brand. It was made MUCH better, simpler, stronger, and easier to install.If you're looking for a wall mount, no matter how cheap or what its for, I would keep looking...",0,Negative
"I'm Using this mount with a 32"" LED/LCD TV.  The tilt and swivel feature works nicely.  The product came with two allen wrenches which are needed to tighten its pivot bolts.  When they're set tightly, the TV stays put, when using the tilt / swivel feature.This product comes in a small package, a deliberate effort by the manufacturer to 'go green' by minimizing its waste packaging, once it's out of the box and on the wall.  Reading the instructions is essential.  Yes, it will take maybe an hour to read the how-to and assemble it.  And by doing that, the end-result will be a professional grade installation.One caveat: If you plan on using the provided wall-anchors, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION to the size drill bit you will use.  The man who did the 'put it on the wall' process used a drill bit that was too large, so the anchors did not get a good grip, so he had to use alternative hardware to fix it to the wall. But the result was 1st class - its mount stays vertical on the wall, and there is no mount-wobble or flexing when swivelling the TV to the L or R.",2,Negative
"This product is wonderful. Listen if your like me and find you may be a little lost because you haven't mounted your great looking plasma on the wall because either your scared or feel like your lacking the know-how to make the risk. Well please take it from me, this mount is nothing short of easy. So dependable if you do not believe me, buy this product for yourself, than hang from it like a monkey before you attach your expensive hardware.Believe me, you wont be sorry. This a great product and you really cannot beat the price.So stop price shopping. Grab this mount and upgrade your living room. Your living room or office deserve's it.",4,Negative
Got this as a deal of the day for my 40'' Sony plasma and it did its job!  Very solid construction but was missing screws (but I was able to use other ones provided with the tv mount packaging).,4,Negative
I have assembled many things in my life and never have I encountered a product that is so poorly designed from an assembly standpoint. I will give it credit for being constructed of solid material but the frustration I had when putting it together made me want to put it all back in the box and ship it back to Amazon.,1,Negative
Used this under the cheetah mount I bought at the same time. It holds the components tight against the wall and hides the wires to the tv.,1,Negative
"I gave it a one because they wasted my time dealing with ordering and returning it. AMAZON quickly handled the return. All I did was open the box and saw the shelves, measured them and realized they were full of it. The item listing claims 18x16, the details 17.5x13.75 (surprise), and it reality going from the farthest edges to edges, 15.75x9. Nothing I have will fit on that without hanging over the edges.  I will never buy another product from the maker again because of the misleading description. They need to provide an actual accurate diagram drawn measurement of the shelves. I did not call them as nothing they would say could make it bigger and as advertised. It was a nice strong item, too bad it was not as described. As i write this it is on the way back to AMAZON via UPS.  I know what I got and it was not what I ordered .",0,Negative
"Instructions are terrible.  I put it together but had to use extra hardware.  The metal rods that go all the way through from top to bottom were too long.  I had to add five washers on each side to make up the difference.  Otherwise the whole thing would be very loose and you could not tighten up.  Other than having bad instructions after the modifications, it looks nice on the wall.  The wire track is very tight so don't plan on fishing wires in and out after it is hanging on the wall.",0,Negative
"Assembling this unit is easiest with two people. The instructions aren't great, but with patient examination of the pictographs, you can figure out how to put all the pieces together. The included drywall anchors are junk. If not mounting it into a stud in the wall, get some decent drywall anchors at your local hardware store.I think I got as much or more than I could expect for $30, however.",2,Negative
"The rods that connect the unit together are the wrong length and the entire unit cannot be assembled without replacing them.  I have asked for replacement rods and will update this review if they respond.  At this point my intention is to return the entire unit and purchase something that is not made from pot metal and poorly engineered design.Vendor contacted me and told me it was sending new rods and cap nuts and was to email the notice of shipping.  To date I have not received notice of shipping and frankly I am tired of this partially assembled unit lying on the floor.  If I do not get these parts in the next few days I am returning this to Amazon.I am now returning this unit.  After further inspection the bracket that holds the unit to the wall has a fatal flaw.  It will not fit into the curved cable guide / frame because the corners of the flanges that are secured to the frame are not curved to fit.Based on my experience with this unit and a flat screen wall mount also of the Cheetah brand, I will never purchase this brand again and recommend others stay away from this brand of products and this vendor..",0,Negative
"Installed this, but somewaht disappointed not necessarily by the product but the concept itself - may not be a great idea. The wires still hang out (unless you do additional concealed wiring) - so think before you buy something like this",0,Negative
"When I made this purchase I should have taken a better look at the product, I think I could have made a better choice but hopfully this will help someone else for a future purchase.The company shipped in in a timely manner and there were not issues with that so no fault on Cheetah Mounts.My issue is the mount itself each shelf is a 2 piece setup and there is no real construction to it. They slide into some cheaply made plastic brackets and use some small metal piece on the front to hold them together. This is an awful design, The shelving is so flimsy and they bowe really bad in all directions with any equipment on them.If you're looking for a one piece shelf that is sturdy go a different route.",0,Negative
"I bought the dual-arm mount for a 42"" plasma and a 1-arm mount for a 32"" lcd. The dual-arm mount was cheap and looked durable.

"I purchased this mount for a Sceptre 42"" HDTV. The TV itself is 38 lbs, well below the ratings for the mount, however, once mounted, the TV tilted forward. No matter how far the tilt adjustment screws were screwed in, the TV sagged forward on the wall. It is not capable of sitting at a flush 90 degree angle.

"I wall mounted a 47&#34; LG TV (model 47LM4600) that weighs a mere ~30 lbs without the stand. Yet I still notice about a 1/4&#34; droop on the TV. Furthermore, controlling this downward angle seems to be difficult. I found it difficult to keep the TV at a level position.Otherwise, the kit's instructions were fairly straight-forward and it includes a useful magnetic level.",0,Negative
"Unfortunately this product arrived crooked out of the box. The two brackets that are meant to mount evenly against the wall are crooked and it won't lie flat against any surface. That's totally unacceptable for something meant to distribute up to 110 pounds of vertical weight -- the entire bracket should contact the surface. If I were to install this, it would wobble and potentially damage the wall.The swivel part of the mount does not move easily and requires some pulling. I plan to return this and spend the extra money for a quality item at Best Buy, Home Depot, etc. Just glad that I didn't drill any holes yet, or else I'd really be regretting it.",0,Negative
"As others stated it does have a lean to it but if you lag bolt it that sucker holds. My brother is about 200lbs and he hung from it, now granted don't do that if you don't know what you're doing when it comes to bolting things in, but trust it wont fall on you.",0,Negative
"I have previously installed two Cheetah Mounts; one articulating and one flat mount.  Based on that, I ordered this mount for a 33&#34; Toshiba we were retiring to the workout room.The mount itself is substantial; It is heavy and has a qualtiy feel to it.  Attaching the mount to the wall was simple, and leveling was made easy with the bubble levels included with the mount.Once I attached the tv to the mount, the bracket holding the tv began to tilt downward.  Even when pushed flat against the wall, the tv tilts downward about 1&#34; to 1 1/2&#34;.We will learn to live with it, but given the cost of the mount, I was disappointed.",0,Negative

"I purchased this to mount a 55&#34; TV on my wall.  The whole thing seems sturdy except the tilt foward and back.  With my 55&#34; TV I have to drill 2 additional screws to keep the TV from slowly creeping the tilt all the way down.  And that did not even solve the whole problem.  If you have a light LED TV this will be no problem.  But mine was just too heavy.  Lucky for us, we mounted our TV higher on the wall so the tilt kind of works for the space.Lose one star for the tilt issue",0,Negative
"Purchased to mount a flat screen, this sucker is heavy duty! No worries of it bending or sagging, easy install. Shipping was high but it's heavy..",3,Negative
Ony issue I had was it did not include the 4 mm screws needed for my tv. I would order again.,2,Negative
"At first glance, this mount looked sturdy and well made.  Assembly and wall-hanging were straightforward and easy. However, once the full weight of the TV was placed on the mount, it began to sag rather badly. The arms and joints torque, allowing the top of the TV to lean forward. Even after putting spacers  under the bottom of the mount to compensate, there is quite an angle to the TV screen due to the flexing of the mount. Also, the arms are difficult to move around, requiring quite a bit of force to re-orient the TV.The TV I attempted to mount is a 52'' Samsung plasma, it's only a few years old, and is not incredibly heavy for it's size. That puts it well within the supposed range for this mount.Very disappointed with this mount",2,Negative
"The metal is cheap and thin gauge. The set screw tab that is supposed to hold the TV from being lifted off the mount came bent out of the box. Takes nothing to bend it back into position however stressed metal at some point will fail and break off making this useless. The ""tilt"" feature is misleading in that every time you want to tilt the TV you have to loosen up 4 screws and then tighten back down. Granted I'm using this for a 39"" TV and not anything larger but even with a TV this small I do not feel like this mount is going to make it in the long run. I just purchased an OmniMount OS120FM for my 50 "" TV and that one is better quality with a real tilt feature. Spend the extra money and get an Omnimount, I'd never recommend any Cheetah mount to anyone that wants to have peace of mind about their TV not falling off the wall.Update 3/7/14  The TV is now tilting as I feared do to the set screw tabs being bent.Not more then 30 minutes after adding above update received a call from Cheetah mounts. Will be receiving the 32-65' version which they claim is heavier duty. Will update once received and rate that version.",0,Negative
It holds a 47 inch tv sturdy on the wall.  BUt it seems to sag a little bit.  Not overly impressed or happy with it.  Difficult to move tv in the mount.  Tilting up/down requires a screw driver to un/tighten a screw each time.,0,Negative

It's sturdy and holds the 42 inch with no problem.  I was concerned to use it with the 54 inch anyway because I didn't feel it was built for the larger models even though it says it will handle up to a 55inch.  It was easy to install.",4,Negative

"Installation instructions were pretty straightforward.  Using my level, I installed the mounting plate.  After installation, I've verified that it's level.  After attaching the tv, the tv is never perfectly level.  I would return this, but I've already had to drill huge holes in my wall, just to try to get another one, then install again.  The instructions gave no information if there was a way to remedy this problem by adjusting certain moveable components (though I tried).  It's holding the tv, I'm not going to return, but in the future I wouldn't buy something with these moveable arms.",0,Negative

Entire assembly tightened too much, had to loosen to allow articulation of mount.  Also did not have the machine screws which fit the back of the TV I was mounting.  What else?

"Got a 46&#34; Vizio that I wanted to hang in the kitchen and be able to see it from the eating table (flat against the wall position) and also be able to swing it around so it could be seen from the cooking area, so chose this.Regarding turning the tv,  it turns out the size of it causes the edge to hit the wall sooner than I had projected.  The angle ends up being only about 45 degrees from flat.  Where I'd hoped for closer to 80 degrees. It does seem this shallower angle is just fine....people cooking in the kitchen can still see everything they need.Extended it's very sturdy.  Sometimes you have to get behind it to help guide the arm back to the flattened position, but that's no problem.  This serves my needs very well!",2,Negative
This was so simple to install! The packaging even had the nuts and screws in labeled bags so you aren't searching for the right size.,4,Negative
Even comes with it's own level to use and an HDMI cable too for added value.The only thing that I can say bad about it is that the tilt down is not much so don't mount your set too high if you have really high ceilings.,1,Negative
"I just mounted this bracket on my wall yesterday. The included bubble level is junk. Do not count on it because it is not accurate at all. I used my own level ruler. I used this to mount the 55"" Samsung ES7100. Unlike my Panasonic LED, the 4 VESA mount screw threads are recessed in on the Samsung. I tried to use the included spacer and screws from this wall mount kit but they are either too long or short. Fortunately I have extra mounting screws from my other Cheetah Mount (model: APTMM2B) that I could use and they fit. Or else, I have to cut the screws a few millimeter down. The arm extends pretty smoothly, just the right amount of stiffness. One person could do the adjustment with the TV mounted.This mount only allows you to mount on a standard 16"" spacing studs. The standard wall plate will not fit in between the mount because the spacing is too tight. So those wall plates have to be either above or below the mount. Plan accordingly before you cut holes in the wall. Other than that, no issue with the mount.",2,Negative
"Materialize is OK, but not strong enough if you going to install over 50&#34; TV set. You can see the swing arm is too skinny plus the spacer on both upper and lower arm busing is the weak point that make the movement unstable. Either you adjust the tightness of each of the screw. Result,either too tight to move around or loose if looks like falling down. What I suggest, the manufacturer should pay more attention to their swing arm design. That is not on really technical design work. Lastly, regarding the jam screw on the back to hold the TV. when you try to tighten it, the support frame will bend down. That show the material on the main frame is weak. What I do, I insert a lock nut to tighten it after the screw is correctly set up. This may help a bit of it. I won,t compliant of it, as you see how much you pay for it. Good Luck to all the user.",0,Negative

"I installed this cheetah with little difficulty, although the instructions are not great. I use it on a 55 LG which weights about 65LB, well below the manufacture suggested limit. The problem came when I tried to adjust the tilt mechanism. No matter how tight we made the adjustment screws when I let go the set just tilted forward. In order to get the tv straight up and down I ended up wedging two blocks of wood behind the tv against the wall. I reached out to the manufacture for help, but got no response.I want to update my review, by saying that I was contacted by Cheetah, and they sent replacement bracket to correct my tilting problem. Unfortunately the replacement brackets did not fit on my mount. They followed up with. Phone call suggesting I adjust the height of the brackets to better accommodate my tv., but that also isn't possible. The set is fine with the modifications I made, and has been up with no problems, for several months. This product is fine but is not appropriate for larger tv's",0,Negative
"This product is built well for it's size, but it's a smaller form factor mount. Maybe for a lighter LCD TV it would work but I wouldn't recommend it for that. If i needed a mount for a smaller TV I would have kept it.I give it 2 stars because I feel like the TV would've bent the arms really bad or possibly broke for my 50&#34; plasma which is well within the stated maximums..Quality is good, but should not be rated for such large and heavey TV's",2,Negative
"I have had a 39&#34; tv mounted on this bracket for nearly 2 years outside on my lanai. You cannot find a better deal on any sort of articulating wall mount! I guess if you pull it all the way out it may dip a bit but generally speaking, no matter where you mount it, it will be pushed all the way in and occasionally turned a bit left or right. Without a doubt worth the cost.. in fact i'm really not too sure why people are complaining... you could get a $300+ wall mount and it would still sag a bit at full articulation...",0,Negative
Very irritating to put together! Screws for the mounting on the tv did not fit at all. Either to short ro long and just did not match up for my 55&#34; samsung tv. Its one of the newer models. I had to go out and by a screw set to finally make it fit. Once put together it works great just needs the matching screws. The tv mount itself is bery sterdy and the tilting etc options it delivers is perfect for my home. If you want to go through the hassle of buying some screws for it to make it fit then its well worth it,0,Negative

Also, I ordered 32''-55'' and the box that came said 20''-55''.  Had the product been disclosed properly at 20'', I would have looked closer.  I guess I just figured 32''-55'' means that 46'' should not be an issue.  I was wrong.The problem is that I paid someone to come out, so that adds to the problem.",2,Negative
"Was easy enough to put up but after going to alll the trouble of leveling it just right, when you extend it even an inch it twist and becomes way off level. Now i kinda wish i would have bought a cheaper mount at least that's what i would expect from a cheap one. The tilt kinda works but not well.

"I bought this mount to hang a 55"" Samsung LCD TV on my wall. I have hung numerous TVs before, so I have plenty of experience installing TV mounts. I purchased this mount based on the positive Amazon reviews, and the advertised size and weight limitations. When installing this mount, I was slightly disappointed to learn that the wall mounting holes are a maximum of 16"" apart, which happens to be the average stud separation in a home. There is no room for error if your studs are farther apart, or if you would like to use an offset to center the mount in the middle of a wall that has studs placed in a non-ideal location.However, I was much more frustrated to see how much this Cheetah mount deforms when I placed my 55"" TV on the bracket arms. My TV weighs 65 pounds without the base (I checked before buying this mount) and this mount claims to support up to 115 pounds, so a safety factor of 1.8. I would not recommend placing 115 pounds on this mount under any circumstances, much less 50 pounds. Under the weight of my modest LCD TV, the bracket arms deflected about 1.5"" downward and the TV is permanently tilted forward about 15 degrees. This bracket is unusable and unsafe for large TVs, despite being advertised to the contrary.Unfortunately, I purchased this mount in August 2013 and just got around to hanging it this weekend, so the Amazon return window has expired. I was hoping to contact Cheetah or SPM Performance, but can't find a phone number or email address on the printed instructions or on Amazon.com. I am incredibly disappointed with this product and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I am in the process of purchasing a mount identical to the beefy one I left behind at my last house, which could easily handle the weight of a 65 pound, 55"" TV. I heartily recommend this mount: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002A6H72Q/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid;=Q45BSC1OW32O&coliid;=IHZCT8ACHQO1U&tag;=patrifletc-20 instead of this shoddy Cheetah mount.UPDATE: After receiving a reply from the manufacturer to this post, I reached out to them by email and received no response after 6 days. I followed up with a phone call today and spoke to their customer service department. The rep admitted that, ""they have a problem with the mount flexing, but no TV has ever fallen off the wall."" I am getting a full refund despite the fact that I purchased this mount more than 30 days ago. I can't say that I am impressed with the responsiveness of the customer service department, but I have added 1 star because they let me keep the defective mount to use with a lighter TV, and they are giving me a full refund after more than 30 days of ownership.",0,Negative
Installed this one recently and must admit that it is not the best TV mount you can get for the money.Why?Too narrow makes the stud finding almost impossible to center the mount.Needed the tv to be about 5 inched out from the wall and the mount cannot hold the TV straight.Too heavy TV? Not according to the specification for the mount.Would I recommend this mount?Not really.,0,Negative
"The mount itself would be exactly what I needed for my 40 in smart tv in an exercise room, except the one that was delivered and now mounted is misaligned in such a way that when the articulating arms are used, the tv ends up severely out of level.  In my book that makes it totally unusable since the whole reason you spend the extra money for an articulating arm is to swivel and move it.  But to sell this as is and expect to readjust the level screws at every change is absurd,  This was sold by amazon warehouse as 'cosmetic defects to packaging.'  That's highly inaccurate. This was a returned item that is defective and now resold with a $5 dollar discount.I have another articulating cheetah mount for my 52 inch tv that is flawless, so being a repeat buyer was a no-brainer.  By comparison can't believe amazon and cheetah would allow repackaging of defective returned items.  Worse yet, even if they try to correct this negligence, do I really want to spend the two hours to remove the old mount and replace with a new one?  This could have been avoided with better quality control and real truth in advertising standards.",0,Negative
"The mount is very heavy and sturdy BUT not accurate. I have placed Samsung 55ES8000 and this is one of the light TV in the market and I am unable to keep this TV straight. This always tilts down and the mount that I received has a screw to tighten to stop the TV from tilting and this just does not work. I dont know how to fix this. I guess, you get what you paid for. I will think twice before shopping a mount next time.",0,Negative
Not as beefy as expected.  Would not support my 55&#34; lcd flatscreen. Not wide enough to balance the load of television,2,Negative
"This ad claims that this TV mount can hold 115 pounds, untrue! I just hung the LG Electronics 42LB6300 42"" smart TV that is 26 pounds and when I pull out the TV 8"" the screen dips down considerably. In my mind if there was a 100 pound TV on this mount and it was pulled out to adjust the viewing angle it would collapse.  The fact that it tilts down as it is pulled out is unacceptable!",2,Negative
"I wasted a ton of time trying to make up for the bad engineering of this product.  I have a 42 in LCD TV that weighs 67 pounds, well within the 115 lb capacity of the product.  I'm also very handy and can make almost anything work.  The first problem is the tilt mechanism is really weak.  The screws that control the tilt don't have nearly enough bite to hold the TV up.  No matter how tight I made them my TV couldn't be held up.  It would tilt down to the maximum limit.  I drilled holes in the frame and put screws in to lock the tilt arms in place.  This worked to basically take the tilt arms out of the equation and sure enough the TV stayed parallel to the frame, but then then swing arms drooped so badly that the TV still had a substantial and unacceptable tilt.  Argg.  This product needs not only a stronger tilt mechanism but also the capability for a negative tilt (tilt up) so as to make up for the inevitable droop in the arms.  Either that or it should be advertised to hold TVs of no more than maybe 20 pounds.Previously I bought a different Cheetah Mount that has no swing but does allow up and down tilting.  I have a much bigger TV on that frame and it works perfectly.  So Cheetah has the technology, but this unit doesn't have it.Seriously disappointing, and I'm exhausted by all the times I hoisted my TV up and down on the unit to try to make it work.",0,Negative
"Used this mount with a 42 LG LED TV. I have no complaints about the quality or functionality of the mount. And the price is good. I mounted to the TV to a concrete wall, so there were no concerns with Studs. Having said that... having mounted TVs on interior walls where you need to find studs I know this could cause problems. If your TV has 400mm wide mounting holes (VESA 400x200 or 400x400) then you will have to mount the TV exactly between the studs with no room for adjustment because the bracket is only 16"" long. If you are worried about the exact position of your TV or have studs wider than 16"" (metal framed houses) then you should look for a mount that is wider to allow for more mounting flexibility.",2,Negative
"This was pretty easy to install, came with everything I needed and is very solid. It took me a while to get around to install it, but I've had it installed for a few months now with no problems. I installed it in a brick chimney using the plastic wall anchors, and  it feels very solid with my 42&#34; television on it. I just bought a new 55&#34; television and I'll try it with that in a few weeks.",4,Negative

"When I ordered this item, unfortunatley, I didn't pay enough attention to the degree at which the articulating portion would move the TV.  I needed the TV to be visible at two completely different angles.  I need one with more articulation degrees.

"Have a 60 inch Toshiba LCD mounted on this bracket and it's holding up well.  When extended to almost maximum length the tv gets wobbly and tilting to the side is a bit scary so one must use two hands.  For the price it can't be beat, but you shouldn't mount anything over 55 inch. (yeah, i know i'm probably pushing it)",0,Negative
"I bought this one for my VIZIO 47&#34; smart TV.  That is not a heavy TV, but is sufficient to overcome the tilting mechanism so that the TV is tilted down at 10 to 15 degrees.  I managed to fix it by putting a bolt through the movable hook and also use the included rubber raisers to tilt the lower part of the TV forward.  Works so far.  In other words, the tilting mechanism of the mount does not work as claimed.",0,Negative

"The vesa holes on the display are recessed much like many monitors are with 200x100 spaced holes. I'm not sure if they are all like this but it's been like that on any I have run into so far. The bracket will not fit in the recessed area without modification. I had to file the corners down quite a bit to get it to sit in recess. I happen to be handy so this isn't an issue, but to someone without the tools or know how this bracket might be useless. Using longer screws might end up with someone damaging the display and adding spacers and washers takes away from the stability and solidness of the mount.After the mod it worked fine and the bracket is very solid.",2,Negative
"If the mounting area on your display is recessed, then the included 6mm, 8mm, and 10mm screws may not be long enough.When attaching to a Samsung 245BW, you will need to go to your locally-owned hardware store, and purchase four 12mm M4 machine screws.",1,Negative
I have a Samsung Syncmaster 2494SW monitor.  It has the longer mounts so I needed this to connect to ergotron stand.  The only issue I had is the mount on the back of the monitor is recessed.  The rounded edges of this adapter did not fit into the recess so I had to get longer screws so it could fit on the outside.  $1 at the local hardward store and done.,1,Negative
"I installed this in my kid's room and it hold her 19"" television. No problems with the install and no problems with use. I hung it sort of high and you are able to angle it down so you can view it from bed level.I would definitely purchase this item again.",4,Negative
"Pretty good product.  Really tight to wall which is nice, but kind of a pain to put the TV on during the final step, and/or remove it.They should really include a diagram which tells you what height to drill to get what center of screen mounting height.Used it on a Vizio 70&#34;.

"Purchased a 22"" Panasonic lcd tv to mount on the wall in the master bedroom. It was easy to install. (Locate a stud, mark the place for the two screws, drill pilot holes, screw in the two screws with the mount, attach the other part of the mount to the tv, hang and screw in the two small screws that hold the TV in place on the mount that is screwed on the wall. Use the included bubble level to level the mount. Took me all of 20 minutes to hang the tv. Best wall mount for the price on Amazon.",0,Negative
"Brackets worked very well for the purpose they were intended.  The screws provided were insufficient for the application,  Small lag bolts would have been more appropriate, and this is what I used.  Cost was fine until I went back to order another pack and found that they had doubled the price.",4,Negative
It did the job and was fairly easy to install.  The only thing I didn't like it that it seems to tilt the TV downward (most brackets do I suppose.)  I stuck a board between the back of the bracket and the TV to tilt it up a little more.  This was used in a conference room with a 70&#34; TV.,0,Negative
This sucks. It said it would fit a 32&#34; tv but it was large than the TV and stuck out on both sides.  Then to add insult they didn't pay for  return shipping and they charged an $18 restock fee. 3 weeks after being returned I still haven't recieved a refund for the remaining cost.,0,Negative
"This is a very strong wall mount. It strengths is mirrored in its weight. Mounted without a problem for my 52"" TV.  Also, holds up to the TV weight even when extended maximally.It does extend too far from the wall to really suit me, though. I would like to see it have a smaller profile, so the TV does not protrude so far.  Forget the ""ultra low profile"" hype.Also, I found that making connections to my TV is a bit difficult, but not impossible, since the bracket portion attached to the TV blocks the block of jacks on the back of the TV.",2,Negative
"These are terrible throwing stars.  They don't stick in the wall correctly when thrown. Ninjettas everywhere will be saddened by their man's skills.Really though, it's a good quality metal plate to hold a TV.  How can I review that?  Buy with confidence this is a quality product.",2,Negative
"This is a great idea but in practice very hard to implement as it is very difficult to line up all the holes an 3 different parts (wall-mount, this adapter and TV) and have it come out right. The best I could do was screw the adapter loosely to the wall mount so that I had some play to line-up the holes for the TV. Unfortunately once the TV is on there is no way to tighten the screws. For now it works but it bugs me knowing that the screws are loose.",0,Negative
"Oops, I bought the wrong mount for my TV.  I got a great deal on the mount, but I needed a larger VESA size.  This adapter fixed the problem!",2,Negative
"The product would work as described if it converted the size correctly. Theonly way the adapters work with 400 x 200 is if you have the adapters laying flat against the TV - the reason this has a raised design is so the bolt heads do not rest against the TV. Again - the only configuration that would work for 400 X 200 is to have the bolt heads scratching and pressed directly on the back of the TV. The manual that comes with itself does not list 400 x 200 as a supported size. I'm using because I didn't want to return it and deal with the hassle and I don't have a very expensive TV, but buyer beware. The holes are also hard to get ""just right"" on the mounting screws without one or two of the bolts being stressed.",2,Negative
"Purchased this hoping id be able to change my 200x200 mount to a 400x400 mount, i tried every different position i could find, even broke out the tape measure to make sure i wasn't going insane.......to get 3 of the screws in i had to screw them in at a angle!! and the fourth was so far off i could even get it in, so my tv is hanging by 3 screws right now.......this product is a joke.....guess you get what you pay for.",0,Negative

"I checked a few stores nobody has these. I thought about making some but for the price just buy it,When u put it together make sure the screw-drive head is facing out and the nut is facing the tv.

Great to be able to install base and then attach the mount.  Came with a stud finder and a built in level. Most versatile mount.  I could use it for Every wall installation.Instructions are a little weak.  Don't use the masonry mounts unless it is in block or poured concrete.,2,Negative
"I've always wanted to hang my Sony Bravia on the wall, just a few things stopped me from doing it. One was adjustability, not many had all of the maneuverability I wanted. Second was price, I'm not about to spend $80+ on a mount that doesn't move. And third, ease of installation. Well AmazonBasics Articulating Universal TV mount solved all of those.Installation was fairly straightforward. I started off by reading the instructions that were included and found that I had better luck WITHOUT reading them as there were far too many ""if not using this, use this""  sort of instructions. All of the pieces and parts were all labeled well, so thats a plus.Once I had the hanger bracket on the wall (and bolted to a stud), I proceeded to attach the mount to the back of the TV. After finding the correct length screws to attach the mount to the TV (this kit comes with TONS of screws) I got the mount attached to the TV. I then hoisted it up and slid the mount onto the bracket. Within five minutes I had a completely adjustable wall mounted TV!It is completely stable at all ranges of being adjusted. I was a bit skeptical of it being able to hold the weight of the TV, but it's sturdy!As for the included stud finder, it's completely useless. It was finding studs there were not there and not finding ones that were... so don't rely on it unless you have 1/2"" sheetrock with no texture or paint.And the ""Cord Management"" is absolutely worthless. If all you have is the TV power cord to deal with, it works. But with a Wii, Xbox, DVD player, and Roku, it is absolutely useless.I will definitely purchase this mount for any and all other flat panel TVs. Because for the price, quality, and adjustability of this mount, it just can't be beat!Pros:Price.Easy to install.Adjustability!Fits TONS of different TVs, including flat backed and recessed backed TVs.Cons:Does require to be installed on a stud or in concrete, can't just use a hollow wall anchor.Found instructions not entirely helpful, but was still able to get it installed within a few minutes.",0,Negative
"I upgraded my 18"" computer monitor to a 32"" almost a year ago, and as soon as I saw this wall mount, I knew that new monitor was destined for the wall. I had always been wary (as I'm sure all first-timers are) to hang my $300 monitor on the wall in a house with small kids and three large dogs, but I figured the monitor was a safer place to start than the $1200 TV!Keep in mind, I had never done anything like this before. I usually regulated these types of things as ""man work"" but this particular AmazonBasics wall mount made it so easy for me even though I really had no idea what I was getting into. The included stud finder and the built in level were all I needed to get started (and my drill and screwdriver). I first assembled the mount and then located and marked my studs. I drilled the holes, inserted the anchors and placed the wall mount. Then I tightened the screws, attached the piece to the back of the TV and slid the TV onto the mount. Voila! It really couldn't have been easier for me.It's been up almost a year now and it's still holding up just fine. My 32"" display actually had quite a wobbly base but on the wall I feel that it's more than secure. And now it's up out of reach where it can't get knocked down by kids and dogs! It's also in a corner and over a desk so it's equally impossible for anyone to walk into it and cause damage to themselves or the monitor! I am amazed at the price on this TV mount (and all other AmazonBasics products, to be honest) because something comparable will easily cost twice as much. There is no lack of quality here despite the huge savings, so there is really no reason to wait any longer. If you've been on the fence about whether or not to wall mount your TV or monitor, wait no longer! This is the one you want, no question about it.",2,Negative
"I originally purchased this item as a lighting deal for twenty dollars (original price forty). Finding a mount that swivels under fifty at that time was a steal so I bought one without hesitation. the box arrived and I quickly began to realize that I received an even greater bargain than I could have ever imagined. It came with everything and I mean EVERYTHING. Wall anchors, lag screws, even a stud finder albeit a cheap one. It can adapt to a large or small TV and everything in between - with all the nuts and bolts you need. Installation was painless and solid. This thing has survived my cousins literally hanging on it.I would gladly pay forty, even sixty dollars, for this wonderful amazon product. Sadly, it seems the product has been phased out with no alternative. I'm not sure why Amazon does not produce this anymore. Even the most negative reviews, which aren't that bad, seem glowing. Maybe someday we will see it again. When/If that day comes I'm going to load up on them like a doomsday crier load sup on bottled water and ammunition.",4,Negative
"Don't waste your time if you have a 40"" screen. The arm can't tighten down well enough and you really feel like it will fall off. In fact, once I had the threads of the screws pull out, since they are only held in by about a 1/4"" worth of threads. Really, it's that bad. If the TV is light and small enough you'll be fine. Don't bother on TVs bigger than 32"" if you want to be on the safe side. I'm not saying a 40"" TV can't hold up on this thing... we have two of them setup for tradeshows like this. But it's wobbly has hell and we have to use extra methods to secure it in place. Look elsewhere if your TV is above 32""",2,Negative
"At $50 it is a little more expensive than the products you can get on Amazon...but it is worth it.  We have other mounts that are nothing more than two steel rails connected by two vertical bars.  After about a year we noticed the 55in panel was no longer level.  After removing it we realized the metal rails had begun to bend under the weight of the panel.This is not likely to happen with this Amazon product as the entire mount appears to be a single piece of steel with holes punched out for mounting to the wall.  It comes with a built-in level, a stud finder (to our surprise), there are extensions for the rails that attaches to your TV.  My brother-in-law was even impressed by the product and kept asking how much we paid for the mount, not believing it was $50.This is our 5th wall mount over the years for various TVs in friends and family homes.  I wished I would have discovered this product long ago.  Don't waste your money buying at Best Buy or in the retail stores paying nearly twice as much, if not more.You won't regret your purchase.Note: our TV is a Sony EX500 series and while screws were provided; they proved to be either too long or too short for the ones that fit our TV.  The spacers provided were not helpful because they were either (1) the correct length but wrong hole size, or (2) too long with the correct hole size.  In the end I had to use metal washers with the provided screws.  So I advise you have 16-20 washers on-hand just in case you need spacers.",0,Negative
"Mounting is the way to go when you have a large TV, it clears up so much space.  This mount made it easy.  We had no problem with installation and the included stud-finder and built in level were accurate.  This is a very sturdy mount and for the price range it is in I think it would be hard to find another one that is at the same level of performance and quality.",4,Negative
"After I goofed up & got a smaller Amazon Universal Wall mount that turned out to NOT be compatible with my also new Panasonic 40"" LCD I was worried about this choice. But this time it worked with our 52"" Sony for the living room just fine. I worry about the extreme weight of this thing as being possibly too heavy though? My home is a 1985 built and between the somewhat cheap construction of our home and these California termites...Well, I will hope for the best.Installation took a little over an hour but that is because I am NOT inclined for this kind of thing. And the manual for this is so large it made me paranoid...Also the included stud finder was dead so I ran over to Lowe's to buy a new one. I also bought some sturdier mounting screws. I also found the included level was NOT at all accurate so you may want to check yours if you buy this?All in all, barring any more Earthquakes, I doubt it will ever fail us. Even considering all I had to do to correct minor flaws with this kit, I think it is an amazing value for the money. My wife waited a full week to put her ""stuff"" back around the TV. Expected a true Poseidon adventure epic fail I suppose. I guess after over 30 years of marriage she has just seen a few too many of my ""projects"" go badly? But what shes does NOT know is I maybe planned them that way so she won't ask me to DO anything....I may not be handy, but I ain't stupid!",2,Negative
"I have had experience wall mounting 4 televisions now.  My previous wall mounts I used was a fixed Peerless mount and a tilt Peerless mount.  This mount is of high quality steel.  The lag bolts aren't the greatest looking but I did not even use them.  I had some slightly thicker lag bolts already that I opted to use instead.  I also did not use the stud finder included.  I bought a different one because I wanted the screen.  I was a little worried ordering this because it places your television 3"" from the wall but with the television tilted it has to be away from the wall to allow for the tilt.  Overall, very impressed with the mount and its features.",2,Negative
"In talking to a few friends, it seems this mount is almost exactly alike others sold, and the other ones cost more (sometimes quite a bit more).I mounted this on studs through sheetrock, although the kit contains materials to attach to concrete as well.You prep your TV by removing the stand, adding the rails (and extensions if needed, I didn't need them).  Then you place the large plate on the wall, using the built in level and stud finder.  One small issue with the level, is when it was attached and the screws ground off on the back of the wall, it left sharp pieces.  This means holding it up to the wall it took off some paint, not a huge deal since the tv is going to cover that anyways, but could be an issue if you were trying out a place that may not be final.They recommend you attach it to two different studs, giving some giant lag bolts to do so.  I don't know why the bolts are so large, but I use much smaller to hold items to the ceiling (projector screen, projector, etc) without issue.  Because of the position I was using, I couldn't attach to two studs, instead had to center over one.  I used drywall anchors on either side, and lags in the middle, it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere.  I'm guessing the overkill bolts are for liability reasons, and can't hurt, just in my mind seems silly.Attaching the TV was a pain like other reviews noted, although once I used a flashlight and some patience, it only took a few minutes.  After that it appeared the TV was crooked, even though the plate on the wall was off.  It seems I wasn't as careful on lining up the bars on the tv, so I would make sure to double check that, and make sure your screws are tightened down adequetly.",2,Negative
"This weighed more than theVIZIO M260MV 26-Inch 1080p LED LCD HDTV with Razor LED Backlighting, Blackthat we were putting on it.  It's amazing.  This does not have any of the plastic parts that I have read about in other wall mounts.  The hardware was provided for different installations.  It was very well protected during shipping.The directions in this case were not as straightforward as we would have liked them to be.  There was not the exploded picture that shows you how everything goes together.  Then the directions were in that tiny-tiny print.  I should have used the copier to make them larger so we could read them while we were doing the job instead of stopping and figuring out what each sentence meant.  There are good direction writers in the world but Ammy did not find them for this project. Part of the biggest problem was the lack of labels on each part.  There were fixed or tilt arms that needed to be attached to extension arms.  It was just confusing.  In the end, we figured it out by taking out the parts and looking at the pictures of how they ended up.Security was a big issue for us.  We didn't have any of our televisions on walls and didn't really see how it was possible.  My husband had his television set at an awkward position.  He mostly listened to the news on it.  Now he is able to watch the television on the wall above his desk.  He has not become convinced yet that it would be great to put our living room television on a wall mount but ""Tomorrow is another day.""(Oh, and now that I have seen another review, I have to say: we were not smart enough to watch the video.)",2,Negative
"Regardless of what the mounts claim, I do not trust them unless they are mounted on wood studs. Unfortunately, this mount is only 16"" wide and while that is plenty wide enough to hold the TV brackets, it is not wide enough to mount it in the middle of my wall. Since the studs are not perfectly center to my wall, the mount is not center to my wall. On wider mounts, you can cheat this my mounting on studs but have the brackets attach off center. Your TV must be dead center with this mount (or else it would slip right off).If you do not mind mounting into drywall, have at it!The low profile nature is what attracted me to this mount, but the replacement I found is FAR slimmer and very wide!(B004J4T9N2",2,Negative

"I purchased this mount and there is nothing with it, but if you need clearance for wires behind the TV you are mounting (if you are not running your wires under the wall), then you may have some problems. We attempted to use this mount of a 47"" Vizio flat screen, and we did not use a bridge kit or run wires under the wall because we were mounting over a fireplace and though we don't burn in the fireplace, the same venting is still used for the furnance. There was not enough clearance with this mount and we figured out we needed about 2"" or so.We ended up purchasing a different mount for that television and will use this one for a smaller tv that has it's connections and power plug on a sidepanel so we won't need as much clearance.",3,Negative
"The mount was easy to install, looks and works great.The hardware is just terrible.  The provided washers which go on the mount rails (NOT the TV) don't sit straight because they are too small.  I had to go out and purchase four 1.25in metal washers.  The mount also includes plastic spacers which make contact with the plastic TV case and are pressure mounted.  Again, PLASTIC spacers make contact with a PLASTIC TV case...why the hell aren't large metal washers supplied to alleviate these pressure points?  So now my washer purchase goes from four to eight.It's not a huge deal breaker (and only cost me $1.50) but why not provide adequate hardware from the start?  It seems doomed to fail with the hardware provided.  Again, the hardware in question is mount specific...NOT TV specific.  The assortment of screws provided did fit into my particular TV (Panasonic 32"" LCD).",0,Negative
"In stores they charge double or more for this kind of mount. Crazy. This product seems well made to me - holding up a 32"" LCD just fine. If you get cleanly into studs with all 4 anchor screws, I bet it could hold twice what they rate it at. It came with 7-8 different size of machine screws for mounting the TV to the vertical brackets, but none fit my off-brand kind of small TV. It was easy to find screws that would fit my TV, so no star knock off as far as I am concerned. The only hard part was tightening a set screw on the brackets that locks the TV in place (on the wall mount so it can't fall off). You'd have to really knock the bottom of the set hard to get it to raise up 1/2"" and fall off the wall mount, but a nice safety thing. The vertical bars hang/hook onto the horizontal wall bracket like shelves in a fridge. The more weight on the mount, the less likely it can come off.I don't think they show in the picture, but it comes with little rubber spacers which are to go between the vertical bars and back of the TV (hollow so the screws run through them). The instructions didn't list them as optional, but I knew I wouldn't like the look and didn't use them. Not needed for a TV with downward facing connections, and no affect on how easy / hard it was to hang up the set. You would need them if connections are pointing out the back of the set with no indentation.",0,Negative
"We bought theiSymphony LC32iH56 32-Inch 720p LCD HDTV, Blackand the stand was defective so we opted to mount it to the wall.  Since I got the TV for $198, I didn't want to spend a fortune on mounting hardware.  This was the cheapest stand Amazon offered with Prime shipping.  It worked perfectly.The horizontal bracket bolted easily to the wall with the screws provided, into studs, using a drill.  (The kit also includes butterfly screws sets for drywall, in case you cannot find/or use the studs).  Our only small issue was the myriad screws included were all too thick to screw into the TV; so, we bought the correct screws and washers at Lowes.  Once the vertical brackets are attached to the TV, it hooks onto the horizontal bar on the wall.  There is some room for sliding the TV right and left once hung to help center, or shift the TV for watching.  My only minor criticism is that the horizontal bracket has no caps for the ends (to prevent someone, like a child, from accidentally sliding the TV right off the bracket!)  Other than that, this stand got the job done for a very reasonable price.  It's sturdy and discreet.  Highly recommended.",0,Negative
"I bought this to mount at 55&#34; LG LEDTV to the wall of my apartment.  I couldn't find two studs that were appropriately spaced so I actually had to attach it to a wooden bar that I screwed into the studs.

First of all I don't know where to start with this review the item came on time but we were very disappointed on the product itself the manual description: direction is not correct we kind of figure it out on our own. The mount bracket it did not fit well with my TV so hopefully my TV don't fell off the wall.lol but for some how I make it work but it's not completely flush on the back of my TV I have a high end flat screen television and this does not fit well. Furthermore in this case please do not buy this product if you want we didn't wanted to return it but we could say what a waste of money and waste of time. I guess $14.89 bucks is not a lot of money but it's money!!,0,Negative
"The 1&#34; clearance for cables is hardly forgiving and may require 90-degree connectors (which I used for my HDMI cables). The cords for releasing the bracket (unmounting) are also inadequate in length and hard to reach.

I looked at the included anchors and had to laugh as who ever engineered this bracket has never installed one before. I went to home depot and bought some Spax 2&#34; torx drive lag bolts to anchor it directly to the stud in the wall. The wall will give way before the bracket will if you use the bolts I used. I'm sure you could do pull ups on this bracket when installed this way. I also like the feature of being able to pull the tv out from the wall and angle it towards the kitchen table to see it. Most of the brackets I looked at are fixed. I  would recommend this but spare yourself trouble and buy quality lag bolts first.,0,Negative

"My experience with this mount was not very positive at all. I have installed 5-6 of these types of mounts before, but none were as bad as this one. I was replacing a mount that was currently holding an old tube television. I open the packing to this mount and everything looked to be in order. I took down the old mount, installed the new mount, and unboxed the new TV. Then the issues began. I went to attach the vesa plate to the back of the TV. The tv was 400x200, so I needed to attach the extension arms. I opened the packet that contained the arms, and there were only 3 in the package (not 4). For various reasons, I had to have the TV installed that day, so I couldn't return it, I needed to use as is and hope that the TV doesn't fall off the mount, or shift every time someone touches it.  Beside the fact that the mount was missing a critical piece, the instructions were awful. The pictures were unclear and the typed instructions were even worse. I would not recommend this mount if you can avoid it.",2,Negative
"The Low Profile Full Motion Swivel, Tilt, Swing Arm TV Mount was Exactly the Mount we needed...  We were looking for a TV Mount that could be mounted on the wall and give us full range of motion to move the TV for various viewing capabilities...  We mounted our 39&#34; Westinghouse HDTV on the wall, near a corner, so that it could be viewed flat against the wall or be pulled off the wall and suspended catty-cornered in the corner to be viewed by a larger group of guests. The mounting hardware & the quick release TV Plate were exactly as expected and worked great... Two Anchor Lag Screws tapped into a wall stud was all that was needed to hang the mount to the wall and was mounted in minutes... The quick release TV Plate Worked Great, four screw bolts that were included with the TV holds the plate to the TV & the TV was mounted in Seconds! We couldn't be more happier with this purchase, the price was great & the product exceeded our expectations! The only thing left to do is to hide the half dozen wires...!",2,Negative
"I used a larger lag bolt for the top hole which almost presented a problem due to clearance with the bolts that secure the arm to the plate. You must take your time when installing this so you do not mess it up. Make sure to pre-drill the holes; don't drill too big or too small, there is no suggested drill size in the ""instructions."" Use a stud finder that will indicate the edges of the studs--I used an old, cheap Stanley stud finder. It comes with masonry taps for installing over concrete or block. I deduct a star for not hand-holding a person through the installation--the instructions are scant. You need an open-ended wrench and a socket-ratchet of 10mm for proper installation.- Pre-drill (opt for smaller)- Pre-tap (pre-insert) the screws half-way before attempting installation, make sure they go in straight and square and that you hear no stud cracking- Carefully install, taking your time (put the washers up against the mounting plate and then put the screw through--the washer will not clear the arm mount if you do not)",2,Negative
Well I got the kit yesterday.  Got the mount on the wall kinda easy.  The top screw and bottom bolts have some type of thing blocking it to go in and screw down all the way but I got the top 2 in fine just not the bottom.  But it wasn't really a big deal to me.  Then we get ready to mount the plate to our 42in 400x200 vesa tv and ran into problems.  We spent 1.5hrs trying to figure out how to get the plate mounted using only the supplied extension brackets and still couldnt figure it out.  There's only 2 mounting points on the back of our Insignia TV.  We got frustrated and left it alone.  I won't touch it for a few days because it is very misleading and too frustrating for the average person to figure out who has a 400x200 VESA tv.  I will not be buying this again and if I can't figure it out in a few days I am going to return it for a different kit.***EDIT/UPDATE****After more messing around with it during my lunch break I have figured it out and put it up.  I'm still unhappy with how it is mounted.  The entire plate itself is not flush against the tv.  But where I have it bolted in is pretty firm.  But the TV is up on the wall.  Fully funtional.,0,Negative
"I've mounted a couple other, larger TVs with larger mounts. Those mounts allow you to slide the TV along the mount in order to center it against the wall where you'd like (not just centered on a stud or between studs). This mount is more basic. It's going to be centered exactly where the stud is. Just something to keep in mind as you plan. Installation was simple although a bit odd as it doesn't seem to mount flush/flat to a flat backed TV. Instead the arms come in at an angle to the four binding spots. The arms then dug into the back of the TV a bit. No harm other than small dents on the back. Overall it works and is sturdy.",2,Negative
"its a great mount, but the joints are painfully hard to move sometimes, that also means it is holding together well but if you might have to muscle it a little to get it positioned just right",2,Negative
This is the only mount I will buy for my TV's ...I made a mistake for a few bucks and bought a different type...geez what a mistake...the other one wobbles doesn't stay straight...this is the one you want.,0,Negative
This unit works great for my 32&#34; Samsung flat screen tv I had no problem installing this to my wall. Just make sure you fasten it to a wall stud.  Now we can lay in bed and see the TV up on the wall with no problem!!,2,Negative
"So the mount feels pretty solid on the wall, and it does a great job being low profile, but the tilting mechanism sucks.  I hand tightened the tilting arms to a straight-up position because my install has no need for the tilt, and when we got the tv on the wall, it started to fall forward; the arms didn't hold strong and started to tilt on their own.  They only rely on the strength of a screw to cause friction in order to keep the arms from tilting.  This should have come with some way to actually lock the TV into a straight up position, or the other more common tilting angles.  The TV is finally up now but the tilting arms really bug the hell out of me.",0,Negative
"only bad thing about this product is the screws used to mount brackets to tv were kinda crappy out of the 4, 3 went in great the other had trouble, just bought a set of better screws.  no problesm leveling this product or mounting.  make sure you adjust your TILT before you try to hang it on wall!",4,Negative
"I had ordered one of these for my smart TV (Samsung) and it worked so good when I needed to mount another TV (a 24&#8221; monitor) I got another. With shipping being free with the price of two, I also got one for my in-laws.Three different displays, three different conditions all three worked out great.40&#8221;, 32&#8221; and 24&#8221; with very different screw and bolt patterns and the included hardware has yet to fail me.Note that for none of these displays did I put in all six screws. The enclosed wall screws are REALLY beefy and unless you are very worried about stress form being moved a lot or have an exceptionally heavy display, I would not use all 6.",2,Negative
inexpensive and well built. I mounted a twenty-one inch samsung monitor in my office with no problems.  I would purchase again.,4,Negative
"I'm not even sure how many of these I have bought......  20?  30?  More?  Who knows, but I use these all over the place installing Kitchen Display Systems into restaurants.The mounting screws actually can take a beating and just use a large phillips bit.  A little pre-drill and an impact driver make short work of the mounting.  The built in level makes it that much easier.There is tilt and swivel built into the head.  The big thing here is the swivel as I can be a little off on the install and keep the monitors square.  Another great feature is the mounting.  A lot of brackets aren't well thought out and can be tough to actually get the monitor mounting on it once it's on the wall.  On this bracket, the whole arm mounts to the wall and just the little X part you see on the picture mounts to the monitor.  There is a nice sleeve that it just slides into.  No straining your neck trying to see where it lines up..... Not trying to balance a bunch of stuff.  Just drop, tighten, and move on.The arm is super sturdy, heavy metal.  I put about 20 lbs of monitor, mounting brackets, and hardware on the end of these things and they don't budge at all.  Even fully extended at 18"" there is no play in the arm with the weight on it.  I haven't had one call back to fix these yet.Great product and I'll keep buying it.",0,Negative
"My Samsung 245BWs have a 3x2 VESA screw mount. Unfortunately, that screw mount is also inset a tad bit, which made this bracket pretty much impossible to use out of the box. It required some fabricating, case cutting, and special longer screws from ACE to make this work.Definitely not worth for my purposes, and considering it advertises specifically to do a 200x100 to 100x100 mm conversion, I'd say it's not great for a lot of people.If your backing is flush with the case, or outset a bit, you'll probably be okay, but if your mounting holes were inset like mine were, you're gonna have a bad time.",2,Negative
Well this product did not come with good instructions but I figured it out.  The TV I have has holes that do not line up with this.  But in the end the TV was being held securely on the wall.  But I returned the TV rather than risk it falling off the wall.,2,Negative
"I used this to attach a small media computer to the back of my 40&#34; Samsung. It fit fine and was very secure, but it was missing one of the required screws for attaching the computer to the adapter bracket. It's still fine without it- the other three sides more than make up for it- but it was still an annoyance to realize this came with missing parts.",0,Negative
Got it to get my 100x100 mount to work with a 200x100 monitor. The included screws worked fine. I'm using this with a Samsung 245BW.,1,Negative
I had put a 27&#34; Westinghouse Led tv in my rv with a ceiling/under cabinet mount.The plate that came with the ceiling mount was not quite large enough for the factory holes so I purchased these extenders & it worked beautifully.No complaints here.Glad it worked because I really hate returning items.,3,Negative
"I used this adapter to mount a Zotac Nano computer to the back of my bedroom TV.  The TV only has the TV-size mounting brackets, and the Zotac only had VESA100 mounts.  A similar arrangement I had hacked together with scrap parts and a lot cut-and-try frustration.  This made the process a lot simpler.",2,Negative
"Well the product does work as described, however I had to take the screws from another VESA mount I had because these were too big (the screws were too large of a diameter to grab ahold of the threads on the VESA100 on the back of my TV).  I think they assume that the item you are putting this on will already have screws, and they include ones to connect to the VESA 200 mount.  But my VESA 200 mount already had screws and nuts, but these also were too thick for my TV.  Other than that it does work as intended.One thing to consider is the size of the mount you are placing the TV on.  Mine looks quite comical on an oversized mount.  It has mount poking out from each side, and the top and bottom.Bottom line: I should have bought a smaller mount, not this product's fault, but if you're considering this product you should really decide if your mount is correctly sized.",0,Negative
So I bought a monitor mount and for some reason my monitors don't use a standard 100x100 VESA mounting pattern.  These adapter brackets allowed me to mount them properly.I didn't give 5 stars because the included screws didn't help me out any and I had to run to the hardware store to buy screws and nuts.  But I don't see how they could anticipate every mounting issue and accomodate for the unknown.,2,Negative
"I bought a cheap tv (Coby) led flat panel to take with me on deployment. After deciding that the cheap tv stand I also bought was not going to work for me ( had to look down at the TV,not comfortable), I decided on a cheap TV wall mount. There is nothing wrong with the description of the product. The only problem I had with this was that the back plate also covered all of the available inputs on my TV making it useless. But the simple fix was breaking out a sharpie marker and a ruler and cutting the bottom off.After removing about 1 1/2 inches it works fine.Pros- many ways to position the TVCons- had to do a little cutting to get it to fit my TV",0,Negative
Holds it's weight... I have an XBOX and a Cable box on it. Looks decent. Not the best for hiding cords.,1,Negative

"If you need something to secure your flash to a light stand, and also to mount an umbrella, and you need it to last for more than one photo shoot, it may be better to go for another brand.This one doesn't have the smoothest of actions, and the hard plastic and metal construction doesn't work that well.  On the very first set-up it started falling apart, causing my SB-900 to take a nasty tumble.  There's a small spring bouncing around somewhere on the floor, and I have no idea where it came from.Better to spend more money than be flash foolish.",2,Negative

"inexpensive and rather well made. I only have issue with the screw that holds in the hot-shoe. If you leave it loose, it has a tendancy to come all the way out in my gear bag.

"I got some inexpensive LED lights to replace my old light boxes, and got these adaptors to allow my LED lights to sit on my existing light stands. The cold shoe slider is fully adjustable. When I say slider, I mean the unit must literally slide into the &#34;shoe&#34; housing, then the knob on the side must be turned to tighten the shoe to hold the unit in place. Some may find the tightening and loosening of the slider mechanism to be somewhat cumbersome when setting up or taking down, but I have no problem with it.",2,Negative
"This is the first type of hot shoe I bought for off camera flash/lighting and I was quite disappointed in it. Though cheap, you get what you pay for really.It's very plastic like and looks and feels frail.The major disappointment was the knobs. - They are very small and fidgety and annoying; only to break/snap and fall off.Would I buy this again? No.Would I recommend this? No.Am I going to replace them? Yes.Advice: Beef up the budget and get a sturdier/stronger mount.",0,Negative
"It works, it holds an umbrella + flash just fine.  I prefer the Fotodiox version for around the same price as that one screws into my stand and appears slightly sturdier.",4,Negative
Product is not sturdy - to trust an expensive speedlight to stay in place with this device would not be prudent.  One must ask themselves why the cost of product to the cost of shipping is so out of proportion. Could it be to discourage product return?,0,Negative

"I have had this for a couple weeks now and use it with an SB700 with a shoot through umbrella, it can't support much weight and the screws are a bit kludgie. It works for now but I know it will eventually break. You get what you pay for here and this was cheap.",3,Negative
"Exactly the same product as elsewhere on Amazon for $8.  But I don't recommend it at that price either.  See my review there for further criticism of the product.http://www.amazon.com/CowboyStudio-Umbrella-Bracket-Swivel-E580EX/dp/B0034WR19YSupposedly compatible with the Nikon SB600, 800, and 900.  But the feet of the SB800 and SB900 bend up at the back of the foot edge which will keep the clamp from securing the flash except at the end of the clamp.  That is, you can not mount an SB800 or SB900 in the middle of the clamp.  I assume the other Nikon flashes have the same design and will have the same compatibility issue.In short, don't bother buying this product.",0,Negative
"Held up for a few short shoots, but two have broken simply by being in the case. One lost the screw and plate on top that holds the flash, and the other lost the screw and nut that holds the stand.A perfect example of &#34;get what you pay for&#34; but in this case, it appears that much better options can be had for a few dollars ( literally ) more.",1,Negative

"My sony 40'' lcd tv sits on an ikea TV unit. However, I have no where else to place the soundbar except in front of the TV which sometimes blocks the IR signal for the TV! SUCKSSo I found out about this, being slightly skeptical, I ordered it anyway (Hey, its amazon, what could happen?)The package arrived in what seemed like an eternity (thanks amazon prime for making me expect all shipments should arrive next day!). Came in a nicely packaged flat piece of cardboard.My unit came bent. Well not entirely bent but one piece was slightly rocking while the other was completely flat. No harm no foul, bent it right back myself.Setting up the unit on the TV was OMG such a pain. First I was measuring what to do then screwed them on just to give it a try. After numerous attempts of tryping to utilize both ends of the L bracket, I finally realized, due to sony soundbar's close proximity of mounting hole, the L can only be used on the long end. Well, so I screwed them in, attached the sound bar, and what do you know, I got a nicely mounted soundbar on top of my TV! and it looks damn nice though a little of the round end protrudes out and looks like bunny ears!My only con for this item was that it came with too little accessories. To mount the soundbar, it utilize a very simple screw/washer/ring combo. The soundbar rest on the screw which is secured on the bracket with two washers and ring. Now... the ring they provide were useless! They were either two small(easily dislodges and goes through the long slot on the bracket, which renders it useless. So I had to use my own ring which gave larger surface so the washers would stay on the side I want them to. It was also difficult to secure the two washers to create a firm hold on the bracket.All in all, if you need to mount your soundbar, get it! But be prepared for some handy work or go to local hardware store to pickup some items to make this easier to work with",0,Negative
"This is a good product but with some reservations. It did not fit my 32"" Vizio ""out of the box"". The bolts supplied did not fit the TV. The brackets had to be ""adjusted"" to use on my TV. When I called customer service they simply said go to Home Depot and buy the bolts. CS also said they knew the product did not fit Samsung TVs. No mention of that in the product description. I have kept the brackets so far. I did get the correct size bolts and will try them to see if the brackets fit better now. If not I will opt to return them as the other alternative offered by Onecall.com not so customer ""service"". Buy with caution.",0,Negative

"The Revena DCM-SA1940 is quite sturdy and I am pleased with its performance.  I am using it with a 32"", 20 lb television.  I am rating it 4 stars because of a few nit picks.  The mount is sturdy and I can position it easily to whatever angles I choose and it stays there.  All components and mounting holes were lined up close enough. The level that comes attached to the unit didn't look to be lined up perfectly with the vertical axis of the unit but checking with another level showed it was close enough.  Be sure you mount it with the correct end up, as indicated in the instructions.Important caution: The instructions that come with the wall mount say to use the longest mounting bolt that is shorter than the hole depth of the mounting holes on your TV.  Something important that the instructions don't say is that you need to measure the depth of each mounting hole in your TV separately.  The two upper holes in my TV were deeper than the two lower holes.  If I had measured only the upper holes and carelessly screwed in a bolt that was too long for the lower holes, I could have damaged my TV (not covered under the warranty).  You should also consult your TV manual to see if it has different mounting instructions.  My nit picks: The clear plastic straw that comes with the unit for checking depth of the TV mounting holes was too large in diameter to fit into the holes in my TV (which requires the smallest mounting bolts supplied with the wall mount) so I had to find something else that would not damage the TV circuitry when it made contact.  Because I needed to use the smallest mounting bolts, I needed to add washers to keep the bolt head from passing through the holes in the wall mounting bracket.  The ""universal washers"" that come with the unit are big, ugly, rectangular pieces of metal that I can't imagine anyone using if they had a choice.  I bought real washers at the hardware store.",2,Negative

"This shelving system is made of sturdy stuff and I trust it will hold at least as many pounds as advertised.  That said, the instructions for assembly were not very clear, with gazillions of similar yet ever so slightly different screws, all unlabeled.  The only way we could sort the hardware out was by process of elimination, and it took a while.Once assembled and mounted, we could NOT get the cabling through the channels.  After the first set of component cables, the next set of regular old AV cables got stuck.  We simply could not wrestle them either way, had to actually cut both sets of cables to get them unstuck, ruining them in the process.  We abandoned using the channels, plugged the holes, and strapped the cables with electrical ties and left them exposed.  Fortunately, our installation was in an unfinished basement work out area, with lots of other exposed wiring and such, so it didn't really matter.  But I can't imagine in a living area being able to hide the cabling for two or three components through the channels.",3,Negative

"I gave this a 2 star rating... it's worth the $26 I paid for it.  But I'd rather pay even double that for something like this that is higher quality.  First- this is strictly a ""figure it out for yourself"" deal.  No text in the tiny instruction sheet- and even the pictures are so small you need a magnifying glass to try to make them out.  Second- I needed my own washers, because one screw was too long to fit tightly in my new Samsung 40"" LCD.  Three fit fine- one did not.  Finally, one of the wood screws they supplied snapped in two going into a stud.  That forced me to try to dig it out or move the mount location.  This is the 4th HDTV I've mounted on a wall- but the first time this has happened.  Really- can't you spend a few cents on less cheap screws that will hold up a very expensive TV?",0,Negative
"As the other reviewer said, later model Samsungs will require shorter screws.  Why in the world don't they just include 4 more shorter screws?Be advised that if you want a true slim-fit mount, you need to set the outlet back into the wall, as the plug for the Samsungs protrude past the mount causing your TV to sit on the plug.  Or, you can use the spacers or set the mounts off the wall with wood blocking.  This sort of defeats the whole purpose of these Ultra Slim-fit mounts, but unless you do this and depending on where your outlet is, your TV may end up sitting with the bottom angled up.",2,Negative
"I was worried this would not work with our TV but it does. It's simple, the directions are pictures only and you have to really try to figure out what it's telling you to do. My biggest argument is that MOST people these days are hanging their tv's over the fireplace and because of the close spacing to put up the brackets, we could not place both of the holders on studs. We had to use a sheetrock anchor. My husband swears its fine. I have a feeling we're going to go home and see our tv hanging by a string. I wonder how others got around this problem since most studs are not 8 inches apart.",3,Negative

You can space your monitors out so that they don't touch but I like to see my monitors without spacing so that's where I'm coming from on this.",2,Negative
"I'm using this on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma.Pros:  Very easy install.  Good adjustment capability.Cons:The tilt adjustment knob broke.

As it stands now, I'd have to drill an obvious hole to the side of the mounting arm.I'd be nervous using this on any TV larger than mine.

It's holding up a 26"" LCD monitor, but it would hold one much bigger. Personally 32"" is as big as I would go, but that is only because it mounts to one stud.

I have to say I have a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering and I will tell you right now, this product was engineered to perform as it was designed.  Those of you who have had bad experiences with this product probably couldn't screw a light bulb in its socket much less hang a Flat Screen TV.  This product is highly recommended and if you can hang pictures fairly level, then you qualify to install this Tilt wall mount.  Don't listen to the hype about having TV's professionally hung you are wasting your money for something that takes 20-30 minutes to install.  If you have a drill and drill bits you can hang this product with ease.  I do agree with one review that the lock down screws are somewhat hard to screw in, especially when you tilt the TV.",0,Negative

"Used to mount a 46"" Samsung on a brick fireplace ... drilled holes for anchors into the mortar in case there's no TV in the future and holes need to be filled. The vertical brackets are barely long enough TVs mounting holes with no ability to adjust vert position. Don't think there's enough material to mod them. 1"" longer brackets would work.

"Cheap construction.  Poor (useless?) instructions.  Very difficult to mount TV.  Not enough variety of spacers to meet all applications - had to use Dremmel to shave down supplied spacers.  Unless you have &#34;L&#34; connectors for everything (HDMI, power, etc.) or unless the connections are very recessed, this mount does not leave enough room behind the TV.  Threw it away and bought a much better, more flexible mount.",2,Negative
"This is a very low priced TV wall mount that we purchased for a 37&#34; LCD that we have had for over 8 years.  None of the screws in the &#34;kit&#34; supplied with the mount would fit, one of the mounting bars was bent, and finally the second mounting bar's release &#34;rip cord&#34; broke off during installation!Good thing this is for an old TV that we don't value much because it is a complete piece of junk!",2,Negative
"I hung a smaller TV, 36&#34; on this.  No issues at all.  The hardware that came with it was substantial.  I was able to attach to 2 studs in the wall.  The hex bolts made installation painless, driving screws into studs can be painful, so this was perfect.  Hanging the TV was no issue at all, just screw the brackets to the back of the tv, and lift it into place.  SNAP and done.",0,Negative
"This is the third Sanus mount I've purchased but the first of this type.  The other two are great but I'm not very happy with this one.  I'm using it to hold a 65"" Panansonic TV and the mount just isn't substantial enough.  Its working but I'm a little worried that its not strong enough.  It is only big enough to hit two studs 16 inches on center and I wish it could hit three.  The TV is wide enough for this to happen.  It also has a tilt function but I have had trouble getting the tabs to stay engaged so the TV just stays flat on the wall.  Its a major deal to take the TV down and switch it out so I will probably just leave it but If I had it to do over I would probably look at a different mount.",2,Negative
"I read about the tv not staying perfectly vertical when attached. Well, I didn't plan on the mount flipping back under the cabinet so I put the mount on backwards. Now, I can actually swing the tv out slightly to view while standing at the sink, stove, etc.  The other thing that most people complained about was the slide adjustment not holding and/or you couldn't swing it from side to side if it was tightened enough to hold it in place. Here's the answer, slide the tv and bracket up or down to the height you want. tighten the bracket, and now measure the distance from the bottom of the rod to the bottom of the bracket at the rod. Stay with me here. Now, cut a piece of plastic pipe or something similar (I used irrigation pipe, black) the exact length of that measurement you just made. Now, remove the screw at the bottom of the rod, slide the pipe up onto the rod and replace the screw. You may have to use a large washer to hold the pipe from sliding back off the rod. The tv will now swing side to side with little effort and it will stay at the height you wanted. I don't know why &#34;Arrowmounts&#34; doesn't include a piece of black plastic pipe with every purchase. It's so easy and works perfectly. Bottom line: buy it, modify it and enjoy. You can't beat the price !",0,Negative
"This is not a very good drop down mount.  Once installed, ours really only stays in place down.  It needed some bending to get it really plumb.  It will not flip up anywhere other than in a deep corner cabinet.  Regular 12"" deep cabinets will not work with this (unless you always keep it down).Difficult to install because part that attaches to tv and part that attaches to cabinet do NOT detach for installation.",0,Negative
"I liked the GSI wall mount kit I previously ordered so much I ordered another one.  In my order history, I just selected this bracket and reordered another.

"I have mixed feelings about this product.  I bought it to mount aSamsung UN37EH5000 37-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV (Black)to the wall in our kitchen/eating area.  I got the TV mounted, and the articulation is the 90 degrees left, 90 degrees right (total of 180 degrees) that was advertised.  But the TV, which weighs less than 30 pounds, sags a bit to the right when I have the arm folded to the left, and it sags even more when the arm is folded to the right.  The sag appears to be in the elbow joint, i.e. the joint that connects the two arm parts of the device.  The leveling device that is included with the product was off by quite a bit, between 10 and 15 degrees, which would have accentuated the ""folded to the left"" out-of-level condition. Fortunately, I didn't trust the leveling device and used my own level to get the wall bracket mounted correctly in the vertical position. So I'm left with a 37 inch HDTV that's about 1/4 inch lower on the right than the left (courtesy of the elbow joint sag) -- not a huge issue by any means, but I can see it, and I don't like it. Another thing I have against this product: it is meant to be mounted to a single vertical wall stud, which may or may not (probably not) leave the TV centered in the space you want it to occupy on the wall.  I had to have it mounted between the studs to fit the available space, so I had to open up the drywall and add horizontal 2x6s between the vertical studs for mounting purposes -- and that added a lot of work to the project.  So if you need to have a TV mounted very precisely on the wall, you probably will have to open up your wall to install mounting lumber -- or get a wall mount that has some flexibility in its horizontal positioning.  If I had it to do over again, I think I'd choose a different wall mount.",2,Negative
"This is a heavy duty good value mount.Pros:-Good value-Heavy/Solid construction-Holds up to 80lbsCons:-I guess my only gripe with this product is that you cannot adjust the top down angle of the product on the fly. You have to loosen the screw; then adjust how it angles (towards the sky or towards the floor); then tighten the screws to set it in place. (NOTE: Wall to Wall/Left to Right adjusts just fine on the fly)Also just a note, the main screws to the wall use HEX screws so it was kinda a pain to drill em in there without the best tools. I believe 1/2 inch heads.",0,Negative

I used it on a 47&#34; LG which has a 400 x 400 mount. works just fine. you can always use a converter if you have mounting screws that are further appart.,0,Negative
"In spite of the item's description, this product will not fit many LG 42"" and larger TVs. It fits the smaller VESA 200x200 standard mounting holes. Larger TVs use VESA 400x400. This mount is built like an AK-47. It's heavy and looks like it could survive a bomb blast. Unfortunately, Amazon's ""you bought this, and this goes with it"" algorithms have failed to recommend the correct mount for my TV. I have a 42"" LG LM6200 and even though it fits within the range listed on the item description, it uses VESA 400x400 mount pattern. Now, I'm stuck trying to find a VESA 200x200 to 400x400 adapter plate to fit the TV to the mount. Hopefully that will work because oddly enough, NO ONE, not even Amazon or LG, sells the proper mount for my TV, which would be the LSW400BG or LSW400BX.",0,Negative

"There are two disc shaped supports that have to be screwed to the wall to hang the wire that is screwed behind the TV. Once the two support discs are screwed on the wall the support discs are less than 0.5"" apart if you're installing a 32"" TV or VESA 200x200). So its extremely difficult to hang the wire on the support discs because they're too close to each other. As such this product is NOT suitable for 32"" LED TVs but okay for LED TVs 46"" and larger.Also, the wire lock (to lock the wire that hangs the TV on the wall)that comes with the package is so small with very tiny nuts, that unless you have a lot of working space behind the TV while installing, its very difficult to tighten the wire lock nuts.",0,Negative
"I got 2 of them, one for my 46 inches UN46D6300 and other for my Sony Bravia 32 inches tv.One note for everyone using this to mount their 200x200 or 400x400 TV on a Drywall with 16'spaced studs beware its not an easy task, though not impossible.Let me explain why.The bracket parts that sit on the wall have to be distanced lesser than the 400mm for you to hang your tv up like a picture frame as given in the instructions.With wall studs being 16' apart which is almost 400mm. Now the screw holes on your tv sits right in the line of the studs on the wall.So its no more like the image shown, its more like an '|-|'To make it easy if you let the wire longer the bracket parts on the wall might not hide behind your TV. It took atleast an hour or more just to hang my 400x400 tv on the wall.With 200x200 its further worse, the wall brackets have to be minimum 16' apart while the screw holes on tv are just 200mm apart :)Imagine the image of the product bein inverted '\-/', its exactly how I got my 200x200 tv on to wall. As it had more space between screw holes and top of TV I could let the wire long enough to hang it easily on the wall. But that means the TV is no more clinging to the wall it falls ahead a litte because of the extra long wire. Hung it a little high as its tilted forward a little.Think this would be a problem even with the standard Samsung Ultra Slim wall mount, so not deducting any points for this.If you have concrete wall, you can dril holes where ever you want, buy this without second thought.Overall satisfied with the quality and instructions are very good and I mean really good. As it is a universal wall mount, you might need a run to your hardware store for few screws as every TV has different sized screw holes.",2,Negative
"I purchased these for mounting three Samsung TVs.  Previously, I had purchased the original Samsung mounts for another office, but they can be costly.

"I purchased this item to hang a 40"" Samsung TV, but we decided that the TV would be better on its stand and put the unopened Mount-it! MI-104 kit in a closet for future use. We recently purchased a 60"" Samsung LED TV (about 65 pounds) that we wanted to hang. Since the MI-104 kit was rated to accommodate this TV, I thought ""why not"".  I attached the brackets to the TV, they fit fine, but the materials and installed hardware felt much less secure than the Samsung-branded mounting kit that I had used to hang a different 40"" TV several years ago. The wall disk hangers and supplied drywall augers were completely inadequate and they failed a test where I put a cord over the two disk hangers and pulled down parallel to the wall to simulate the force from the weight of the TV. The disks tilted forward (too much play in the holes in the disks around the screws) and began applying a tension force to the augers and they began to pull out of the wall. Better to fail the test than have our new TV crash onto the floor from 5' up. The Mount-it! is now in our trash bin. I don't recommend ordering this product for hanging anything weighing more than 10 lbs.",0,Negative
"Was disappointed that it didn't fit on my Samsung 46D6400 TV without going to home depot. There is two types of screws attached, one were too short to grab any thread and the other ones were too long so it was loose. after getting proper bolts from home depot everything works fine.",0,Negative
"This wall mount is advertised for 32-60 inch TVs, but it barely fits my 55 inch Vizio TV.  In my opinion, you have to screw the two wall disks into a stud.  The dry-wall screw which is included in the set, is just a joke.  I can't imagine these dry-wall screws to hold a 55 inch TV for any period of time.  This means you have to install the wall disk about 16 inches apart.  The holding wire has to go over both wall disk, and has to be fixed to the mounting holes on the back of the TV.  You need a bit of slack in the cable to thread the TV with the wire over the two wall disk.  And this is the problem with my 55 inch TV.  The cable is just a bit too short.  It takes a lot of trial and error until the TV hangs over the two wall disks.  The holding wire should be 2-4 inches longer.Other than that, the wall mount is very slim, and the TV hangs just like a picture on the wall.",0,Negative
"For the price, this mount bracket was worth purchasing.  It was easy to get the horizontal piece attached to the wall.  However, the kit did not include the correct size screws for attaching the vertical mount pieces to my television.  The kit comes with varying lengths of M5 and M6 screws and my TV needed M4 screws.  It took a couple of trips to the hardware store to get exactly the correct length screws to work with the combination of TV + bracket + spacers.",2,Negative

This TV mount enabled me to tilt the TV the fifteen degrees I needed to see the picture while lying down crystal clear. CAUTION: If you are mounting your TV more than a few feet over your bed, this may not work for you. The fifteen degree angle worked for me, but that was the limit of this mount.",2,Negative

"Excellent value.  Plenty strong to hold my 22&#34; LED TV.They seem to have replaced the &#34;aluminum&#34; lag screws some owners complained about.  Mine were 10.9 alloy steel bolts.  Drill the recommended 7/32&#34; pilot hole, lubricate the screw with some cooking oil, and you should have no problems.  And don't even THINK about mounting the bracket on sheetrock with anchors.I still haven't figured out how to tilt the TV on the bracket.  When I try to change the angle the entire wall mount moves.  Maybe it requires loosening the nut on the bracket, but I can't figure out how to do that while the TV is attached (the instructions show using the wrench (spanner) to loosen the nut but the space is so constricted I can get the wrench on the nut but there's no room to turn it).  One of these days I'll take the TV off and see if it works.",0,Negative
"Fifteen bucks? Cheap. I figured at that price it's disposable.Wall mount wood screws have a METRIC hex head. Found that to be the only annoying featureto this product. Used it to mount a 20"" TV to the guest-room wall. Worked perfect.Used my own hardware.",4,Negative
"First I am a trifle annoyed since the price dropped $2.00 this week.  I paid $14.99 which I thought was a good price.  The wall mount is quite sturdy.  They do insist you find a stud to mount it which frankly for a 19"" is probably not necessary but for larger or heavier TVs or monitors may be necessary.  The quality is good.  The hinge nut actually gets in the way of using a socket set to drive the included lag screws into the stud.  The little wrench they give you is next useless due to the small size and thin grip.  Drill your pilot hole deep enough and you won't have as much trouble as I did driving the lag screws.  The included screws were too deep for the VESA mount on my TV but a couple of washers allowed me to use them. Overall this is a very good value for the money.  Only the hinge nuts getting in the way keeps it from a five star review.",0,Negative

The arms were a bit tight to move, but I don't see that as a problem.  Like some of the other reviews, if you were placing a heavier TV or monitor, I would recommend a different set of screws.  If you are mounting something up to 22 inches, I think the enclosed screws will be just fine.Definitely will consider buying again to mount some additional monitors.",2,Negative
"It all mounted very well and seems extremely rugged, but the tilt control is by an allen head screw, with a supplied allen head wrench. Well, the wrench doesn't really fit the screw head, and the screw will not tighten. For us, we wanted the TV tilted all of the way down anyway, so, it's not a problem, but, beware of this shortcoming. I did not try one of my own allen wrenches.Also, I wouldn't even consider using lag bolts to mount this, especially into the crap compressed sawdust board that is used in RV's. I used through-holes with machine screws, washers and nuts. I trust steel.",0,Negative
"I use this for my 23&#34; monitor on my PC.  The articulation point at the wall and the central elbow are stiff and stay in position well.  The tv/monitor attachment point moves very easily with the slightest bump, but will stay in position if not touched.  Mounting the unit to the wall can be a big pain.  The holes for the mounting bolts  sit behind the rod for the articulation point making it difficult to screw or ratchet in your mounting bolts as it has to be done at an angle without direct downward pressure.",2,Negative
I was looking for a mount for a 22&#34; LED TV and came upon this one. I was hesitant because of the low price thinking it would be cheaply made. I was wrong.

"Mounted a 22&#34; screen in the bedroom. Locked the tilt with provided allen wrenches and it looks real nice.  Others complained about the screws breaking on install.

"This unit, while appearing to be good construction, did not even fit into the the recessed area on the back of my TV. The machining tolerances are WAY too loose, and there is too much metal along the outside of the bracket that bolts to the TV.

"The arm that connects directly to the TV cannot sustain the weight of even a relatively small LED TV if it is mounted so that it has a vertical motion.  If mounted to a side wall, allowing the TV arm to move horizontally, there probably would be no issue.

Mounting bracket itself is of a good quality -  reasons for the negative review then?The design of the product is flawed at many points.  The main flaw is that the screws that hold the armature onto the wall bracket cause the provided tool to not be able to tighten down the wall screws to the point that they securely will hold the wall bracket tightly to the wall.Second design flaw is if you remove the armature to install the wall bracket - the armature will not tighten back up to the point that it should be in order for the product to function correctly and fully.Third design flaw is that the tool provided to tighten up the wall screws is toy size and trying to tighten up 4 to 5 inch screws into the wall stud using this tool is a test of endurance and brute strength. The screws do not seem to be a standard size so that a better tool could be used - this reviewer checked multiple socket sets with none in any of the sets working on the screws with this product.This is not the first wall mount this reviewer has installed but is without question the worse after spending several hours with most of the time being spent trying to tighten down the wall bolts with the tiny toy this reviewer has repackaged the item for return and spend the afternoon with managing only to cosmetically damage the wall.  Television is still using the table stand and will be until reviewer can purchase another brand of wall mount.

"Unit is solidly built, but the end caps on the rotation shaft of the mounting plate make it hard to insert the lag bolts into the holes in the mount panel.  As a result you have to put the lugs in the mount at an angle until they are all the way in.  Then you can bolt the unit to the wall by inserting both lags at the same time and turning one lag head a few rotations and then switch to the second lag and turning it a few turns.  Thus by switching back and forth between the two lag bolts you can slowly attach the unit to the wall.  That is the only way and it is time consuming, but it does work.  It's too bad they didn't just make the mounting plate a half inch longer so the mount holes could be out of the way of the end caps and a regular socket wrench would work, or at least you could fully tighten one lag and then do the second one.  Other than that issue it is a solidly built unit that works well.",0,Negative

"Because It is a pain to get on, the bot sticks too high up and getting a socket or wrench on there is a pain, I have 2 of these because they are EXCELENT mounts, but I do take the arm off of the base whenever I hang these, frustrating to put up, but they work perfectly and are in the right price range",0,Negative
I bought two of these. One for 19 inch LED TV and one for a 29 inch LED. Works great for both. The only complaint I have is the wall mounting bracket holes need to be about 1/4 inch or more farther apart on the bracket. The holes are too close to the vertical bolt and nut between the holes making it impossible to use a socket wrench to install the lag bolts. I had to use an open ended wrench to install the lag bolts which made it more difficult since I was installing inside a wall cabinet.,0,Negative
"For $13, I can't complain much. It feels sturdy and keeps the TV on the wall. It doesn't articulate up or down and the joints are quite sticky. You need two hands to move it because just grabbing one side puts a lot of stress on the bezel of your screen. Loosen the screws a little bit and put some locktite on it after wards. Also add some bearing lube to the joints and it will loosen up.",2,Negative

"I used this to hang a little 19-inch LED TV in out RV.  The engineer who designed this wall mount did not stop to think about the installation piece of the puzzle.  In order to use a ratcheting socket to tighten the lag screws you secure the mount to the wall with, you must remove the arm from the wall mount piece.  The bolt and nut from the articulating arm hang down just close enough to the mounting holes that you cannot get a socket on the lag bolt.  I ended up disassembling it halfway through installation.Other than that, the mount seems to be sturdy and does provide an array of adjustments to place your TV exactly where you need it.  No issues with the quality.",0,Negative
"I have no doubt that more expensive mounts are easier to adjust, but mine is a set-and-forget situation. As long as the mount held the weight, cost was the most important factor for me. The construction is solid enough that I have no worries about hanging my 27&#34; monitor with this mount. All of the joints can all be tightened or loosened as needed. I have not had any issues with slipping - I mounted my monitor two months ago and it is still in the same position",0,Negative

very small and compact but does the job.  Instructions are TERRIBLE (&#34;translated&#34; from ???) but illustrations are ok.  Make sure to loosen all of the nuts or else you will not be able to adjust it. They come really fully tightened and once on the wall are difficult to get to!,2,Negative
"used it on a 19&#34; lcd samsung, very light weight. it barely even holds it. the hardware with it, is horrid, and not workable. I had to to use my own hardware and even epoxy to get this thing on the wall. it does come assembled, and you have to take it apart to install on the wall and attach a tv to it. it was priced cheap, i just expected much better.",4,Negative
"I'm using this for a very small 12&#34; TV in my office. This gets a five because it is well made and simple.My situation was not &#34;typical&#34; and I broke a few rules that you probably can't with a larger TV. It went up easily, even though I ended up using drywall anchors, and buying small nuts with bolts for the rack because my TV came with the screw-head slots instead of actual drilled holes. Before mounting to the wall I dropped screws into my TV's screw-head slots and held them in place with pieces of U-glue. Then I set the rack over the holes, and the u-glue not only held it all together it also anchored the screws enough so I could get the little nuts tight enough. Then I screwed the drywall anchor screws down and all is well.",0,Negative
"This small TV mount is rock solid and remarkably adjustable. You could spend more $$$$, but you will not find a better small TV mount that is adaptable to any mounting configuration.",1,Negative
"I have installed many media systems for a living over the years.  In the past I have spent nearly a hundred dollars on a very similar mount and it wasn't nearly the quality that this one is.  I don't know what the previous reviewer was complaining about with the screws. They must have missed the stud.  This kit comes with a few different screw sizes for mounting to any small TV or monitor.  I had to ad washers to mine because they were a bit to long, but theres just no way for any company to to sent you every possible screw with a universal mount.  This setup is nicely built and I would have no trouble purchasing alot more of these for smaller monitors.",2,Negative
"Works good for my monitor. I thing that sorta sucks but really no big deal is if you use a socket to mount it to the wall you can do it on the top lag bolt but on the bottom you will have to use a 1/2 wrench  (how many time you gotta do that anyway). But I took it all apart anyway to put anti-seize on the bolts (not the ones going into the wall), screws and pivots. Also it rotates 360 degrees so I use this monitor, really a 19 HDTV, sideways to look at PDFs on.",0,Negative
"Update:  2 weeks after install I was just sitting here surfing the web, not touching the monitor at all, when one of the bolt heads popped off.  This was from the bolt that is screwed directly into the stud in my wall.  About 10 seconds later the head came off the second bolt and the monitor crashed down onto my glass desk.  Luckily the desk did not shatter, but if it did it could have ruined thousands of dollars of electronics.  I'd call it a fluke but it happened to both bolts I was sent and if I look at other reviews, it seems common.  Bottom line, do not use the bolts that are included with this mount.  I really like the arm itself but it is still being shipped with bad mounting hardware so only 2 stars since you can't actually mount it without going to the hardware store for new bolts.I got this for a big, heavy Dell 24"" 1920x1200 monitor.  Used a stud finder to locate a stud, measured twice, and bolted it to the wall.  Attached the monitor and have had no issues since.  I got this wall mount so I could bring my monitor closer for Photoshop and gaming and then move it back out of the way when I'm not using it.  The hinges have enough resistance to keep the monitor in whatever position you want and they are adjustable so you can even lock it into place in any position.  I left mine at the factory resistance and I move the monitor around all the time with no issues.  It offers tilt, swivel, and rotate (but no height adjustment) and can hold your monitor 15"" from the wall (the most I've seen from similar products is 14"").  So it has every feature I could ask for and it costs $15 shipped.  I don't see how I could give it anything less than 5 stars.  If you need a wall mount, the reviews on this one are accurate.  Definitely holds up to the much, much more expensive wall mounts out there.",2,Negative
"I got this for a cheapie 17"" TV that I mounted out on my back porch.  It seems to hold fine but I dont know that I would put much larger than a 19"" TV on it.  It doesn't seem extremely robust.  It will do the trick for what I need though.",2,Negative
"Not super, but it gets the job done.  When you mount your TV using this, it'll be kind of shaky, not a solid hold.",2,Negative
Been using it for a while now. The mount holds the monitor steady and strong. No problems with the product.,4,Negative
"Changed my review by one star.  Even though it was a challenge to work with, it was just what I needed for this TV project.  Just be aware that your TV may need alternate screws from a good hardware store.Original review: After reading the stellar reviews I figured I couldn't lose.  It's a simple design and I like that.  Directions are scant but adequate.  2 reasons for 2 stars.  I can't get a straight shot at using my power driver on the center hole.  The worst is that the parts supplied do not fit my 32"" TV.  I have multiple options (screws) but none of them are good for the Phillips TV my daughter has.  Now I have to go to the hardware store and see what I can finagle to make it work.",0,Negative
The adhesive on the glass that holds the disc in place to affix the glass shelves to the unit just let go. Shelves are small and the spacing is too close. Poor design and shoddy construction.,1,Negative
"Would have given 5 stars, but the screws that hold the shelf brackets to the wall bracket and glass shelf to the shelf bracket were missing.  Luckily I had plenty of miscellaneaous screws to complete the install.",0,Negative
I noticed after one month of use that the top shelf was no longer glued down. I have items on it that do not move around so it's not a huge deal but sucks it broke so quickly.,0,Negative
"In the a/v business I tend to use these types of things alot.I am always on a quest to find the `perfect` wall mount and never seem to find one regardless a high or low end one. The shelves always wobbly,the wire hiding always awkward and overall anything with glass poses certain dangers and also exposures to the install..I wish I could give 2.5* not 3 but didn`t wannt to go down to 2.The instructs are in pigeon English written on cheap paper with odd illustrations but even the modestly handy should figure out without instruct..THERE ARE BETTER",2,Negative

holds my 57 tv no problems with.,4,Negative
"I am mounting this item myself.  While looking through the reviews I simply wanted to know if I could mount a 47&#34; TV without assistance.  The answer is &#34;YES&#34;.  You just need to attach the base bracket to the wall, mount the hanging bracket to the TV and just lift the TV and drop it onto the bracket.The installation was very simple.  I should note I did not use the included hardware and attach it to a bolt because it was easier to just buy a couple of 10&#34; carriage bolts with washers and anchor it through the wall.  This way I didn't have to find the studs or worry about someone leaning on it and tearing the TV off the wall.",2,Negative
"The good: low price, design allows for outlets between, nice spacing off wall( not too much or too little),  reasonably sturdy, one piece backplate.The bad: lack of stops on the end end of the wall bracket means tv can slide off ends if you are not careful. Better mounts have stops. Easily remedied by bending ends with a pair of pliers. Bottom locking screws just bend when tightened. Not a big deal except for the lack of stops mentioned above. If stud locations require mounting tv near the end of the bracket, a bump on the tv could cause it to drop off the end. Minor issue in most situations,The ugly: hardware is questionable. Washers like they are made from aluminum cans. Pretty much worthless.Overall a decent mount for the money that could be made better for a few pennies.",2,Negative
"I ordered this mount for my 55&#34; 75lb Bravia LCD. Had a Sanus tilting mount in my last house, for about 2x the cost. After reading all the positive reviews I thought I would try this one.The Sanus is heavier gauge steel for the wall mount and hangars, and the hangars have crossbar reinforcements; this mount does not. I would not call this mount 100% flimsy, but is is much weaker than the Sanus. Regardless, it came with a good complement of hardware and decent simple instructions. I used the included 2&#34; lag bolts and they worked fine. I used my own level, the built-in one matched it. If you're going to simply mount and hang, it works fine. Would not go much more weight than my 75lbs.One precaution: The stops on each end of the wall mount don't seem effective enough to keep the hangar arms from sliding off . Plan on hanging your TV centered and don't slide to the ends without diligence. The tilt is not so smooth, but if you are going to hang and lock in place it's fine.Finally, you'll probably use an electronic stud finder for locate your studs. But also go to Ace Hardware and get a $3.00 block magnet that you can sweep the wall with; it will pick up the drywall nail or screw and show you exactly where the center of the stud is. I was mounting on an exterior wall so the electronic finder was not precise. My magnet worked like magic.",2,Negative
"Its easy...only 3 pcs.  1 pc on the wall, other 2 on the TV.  Nice that it comes with bolts for most size TV's (e.g. M6, M8, M10 size).  The only thing confusing is the instructions keep talking about concrete walls and using anchors.  This does not need to be in a concrete wall.  I put 4 of the lag screws directly into the wall studs and it aint coming down.  I do NOT recommend using wall anchors in drywall (even if you use all 6).  Do not risk drywall securing only.  Only install into studs.  The spacing on the mount will allow use of 4 of the lag screws regardless of where you want to put it (assuming your wall is up to code with 16&#34; spaced studs).  I have a 65&#34; LED (slim) Samsung hung with this.  But this would hold heavier TV's as well (assuming you install minimum 4 lag screws direct into the studs).  The tilt knobs work well, but you have to really tighten them hard (which is not easy once the TV is hung)...best if you can figure out your tilt and tighten before hanging.  One negative is the bottom screws keep the TV on the mount....most wall mounts have pull strings....this has 2 long PH screws, which is not very easy to tighten or loosen with the TV hung (you have to squeeze your arm in there).  Overall, great.  Ill buy another if I ever need another.",2,Negative
Very sturdy wall mount.  Does what it says and I have no complaints.  Will probably last me until I move out.,2,Negative

"You can't beat the quality of this sanus mount, but it is so low profile that it's a huge challenge to hookup any cables because of handshake. I also needed to buy a 90 degree adapter to hook up an optical cable",2,Negative
"There is no doubt that this is a well-constructed product.  Heavy mount, because it needs to be.  The problem lies in that once you mount the TV onto this system, there is very little room to tilt because the mount is so close to the wall.  I suppose you could tilt it up more than you could tilt it down, but most folks will be sitting lower than their TVs.  Many of the newer large and thin TVs have their speakers (which won't be used in most wall-mount configurations) on the bottom, firing downward or to the rear.  Those speakers typically make the TV just a little thicker at the bottom, which is where you would need that inch or so of clearance to tilt just a few degrees.The other problem is that once you have, say a 60"" TV mounted on the wall, it's almost impossible to get your hand between the TV and the wall to make any adjustments.  The kit comes with an extra-long allen wrench to adjust bracket height - just in case your level lied to you when installing the wall plate - but it isn't long enough to tighten the tilt lock-downs to keep the TV at the desired angle.  This means you have to be exact when setting your brackets BEFORE you put the TV on the wall.  Otherwise, if the lock-downs aren't tight enough, your TV will tilt upward on it's own after a short while.  Try as I might, I could not tighten the lock-downs with the TV on the wall.  Which led to another problem; I had to make sure the brackets were both at the exact angle before tightening them down.  If they don't match, you'll actually twist the body of the TV.  Think about it - TV about 90% plastic, this mount about 99% steel.  Which one do you think will give first?I learned a lot with this purchase and installation.  First timer.  Next one I do, I'll either put up a smaller TV, or pick a different mount.  Do not try to put a 60"" or larger TV on the wall with this system by yourself.  It's possible, but you may end up tearing up the wall, the TV, or both.  For another 60"" or larger, I would not buy this system again.  A smaller TV (and on sale on Amazon), I'd buy another one.",0,Negative
"This is actually the second Sanus mount we purchased to go with our Samsung 55"" TV.  The first one we returned because none of the hardware that came with it fitted the TV, despite all the good reviews we read.  After we returned it, we did some more research and contacted Sanus.  They said while the mount will fit our Samsung TV, we needed to go buy different bolts to screw the TV to the mount.  Apparently, ""universal"" wasn't quite universal enough.  While the product appeared to be good and sturdy and the installation wasn't too much of a chore, a small note somewhere on the box or in the manual would have certainly helped.  Other than that small inconvenience, we have no other complaints about the mount itself.",2,Negative
"I originally ordered a Cheetah Mount for my 64"" Plasma and regret that purchase as soon as I received the cheap Cheetah Mount (no instructions, horrible construction, you name it).I ordered the Sanus based on reviews and functionality for $59 and have never looked back. You get what you pay for, but in this case, at a steep discount. Lots of support, clear instructions and sturdy. Get it, you won't regret it. Yeah it only has 10 degree tilt, but it's often enough to reduce glare, which is often what a tilt mount is for.",0,Negative

It is very easy to install, but I noticed that they came with the same keys for my 2 orders I placed (there are 2 keys included for every order placed). If I were a burglar, I would simply carry those keys as master keys. My point is that the provided padlock is worthless if they all come with the same keys. You better buy another padlock for piece-of-mind.I imagine that there is always a way to outsmart every anti-theft device but the reason I bought this item was in the eventuality to make burglars waste their time since I have a monitored alarm system. So no grab and go in minutes before the cops come! At least, that is my thinking.I rate this product 4 out of 5 stars because of the same keys and identical padlocks.",0,Negative
"I really like the three that I purchased.  I was able to hook all of them up with no problems.  Quality materials, great directions, quick shipping.

"When I originally mounted this unit and installed approximately 40lbs .. the unit was greatly drooping .. the wall mounts were solid however, the where the verticals attached with the horizontals were significantly out of square. the verticals are attached to the horizontals by 2 small screws at each vertex. i was sincerely worried that the unit would fail. however, I realized that mounting some extra diagonal supports between horizontal and vertical wold help to keep from drooping. I went to a big box store and bought 10&#34; &#34;mending plate&#34; and some 3/4&#34; 1/4-20 screws, nuts, lock washers. I pushed the unit back to square and drilled 1/4&#34; holes to align with the holes in the mending plates. I fastened the plates with the 1/4-20 bolts and the rack became rock-solid.

Unfortunately, for all the expansion parts in this rack...it's just not strongly built.  I mounted it to the wall, and was able to move the bottom corner up nearly a half inch with fingertip pressure even after tightening up the corners, the lag bolts, and the hex bolts.  The only way I could make the rack stable was lowering the wall mount bottom leg about 1 inch and then it was out of square.  I ended up going back to the old office and harvesting their old Chatsworth rack because compared to the Tripp Lite, the Chatsworth rack was rock solid.  I mounted the old Chatsworth on their backing board and squared it up. The equipment was solidly mounted to this rack and was not moving a millimeter.I wouldn't put any weight in to this Tripp Lite rack for that reason.I would have sent it back but it was already out of the box and the packaging was lost.",3,Negative
"This product has been doing great for months now.  It installed to the 75&#34; Samsung fairly easily, although the instructions are not exactly clear on what to do for what model.  That is not their fault since there are so many different TV options out there.  The installation did get done and it IS stable.There is a tool provided for securing the tilt feature where you want it. This tool is junk and the reason for the 4 stars.  It is basically a 3 foot long Phillips-head screw driver that breaks down into 3 pieces, but has these weak plastic joints between the pieces.  Mine broke long before the tilt was secure.  It was very tough to reach in and do this manually.  Even with such an enormous TV there is quite a bit of tilt to the thing.You need 2 people to mount this TV.

"The wall mount does work.That being said I do have some input for others:Using this mount causes the back of the monitors to be farther off of the wall than I had expected.

Went on the wall pretty easily.  You have four holes but only two can make it into a stud.  It came with fasteners for drywall but with anything that holds weight it must go into a stud.  The plastic cover doesn't fit securely but it stays on.  Right now it just holds a DVD player and then a Roku player on top of that.  The shelf doesn't have any board or glass; it's just two arms which is what I expected.  No complaint there.  This was for a guest room.  I wouldn't use it in a front room with out a glass or some type of shelf on the arms.It works!,2,Negative

"I bought this wall mount to hold my Blu-ray player.  I picked it because it had the shortest vertical height, and I had very limited space under the TV.  It's OK, and very sturdy, but in retrospect an adjustable mount would have been better, because the arms on this are much longer than needed to hold a newer-model DVD/Blu-ray player.  It's more sized to handle the older DVD players, which were about the same footprint as a VCR, or maybe a receiver.  Because I wanted to finish this project during vacation, I ended up just shortening the arms by about 3 inches with a chop saw.Pros of this product:  Very sturdy tubular steel.  Could hold something much heavier than an a DVD player.  Low vertical height, and can be made even lower if you cut down the decorative cover that hides the mounting plate.Cons:  Arms are longer than needed for small Blu-Ray players and are not adjustable.  The mounting plate has four screw holes, but you can only use two if mounting into a stud, since they're just over 1 1/2"" apart, so your screws would go on either side of the stud.  Two is more than adequate though, since the included lag screws could hold a dozen Blu-ray players.  Rubber feet on the arms help keep the DVD player from slipping, but some sort of a tie-down would help avoid accidents.  The unit I received wasn't completely symmetric -- I had to bend one arm out to even it up.Bottom line:  An extremely sturdy mount, but without the flexibility of adjustable models that cost the same.

"This review is based on the version shown in the picture - it sounds like some people might have gotten slightly different versions of it.I bought this because it was cheap! It often gets re-branded and sold for about 7 bucks (so I wouldn't pay much more).First some information:The main piece has a 1/4"" male thread on the top and 3/8"" female thread on the bottom.The coldshoe is all plastic and has a 1/4"" female threading on the bottom (metal threading). The 1/4"" female to 3/8"" male adapter is aluminum.The 1/4"" to 3/8"" adapter can go on the bottom, so you can connect it to a 1/4"" threading (like a tripod) if you don't have a 3/8"" threading. Great little thing, but it gets stuck EASILY and can be terribly to remove. I own 6 of these and need to use a pliers to remove the adapter (it's so thin that trying to take it off with your fingers will just hurt. I'm not sure WHY it's like this, but it's been an issue with all of them). Manfrotto makes a much better adapter (but costs about the same as this ballhead):Manfrotto 088 Stand 1/4-20-Inch Female to 3/8-Inch Male 20mm Long Adapter - Replaces 3103If you plan to permanently attach the adapter, it's fine. It's only when you need to take it apart (for example, moving from a tripod to a lightstand) that it's an issue, and on location it can prevent you from being able to do that.The coldshoe is a nice idea, but is also filled with problems. There is no hole for the flashes locking pin to connect to (the locking pin being the thing that keeps it from falling out). It's just a flat/smooth piece and trying to tighten the flash can damage the locking pin. Another problem is that it won't work with flashes like the 580EXII which has a rubber weathersealing around the back (it won't fit with this piece). You're better off using the plastic 'stand' that comes with your flash -- if you use this one (which you can't lock the flash into) and have it angled upwards to use the umbrella, it could (and likely will) fall out.Next problem - the umbrella hole. Not sure who designed this, but it's a straight hole. Umbrella holes should be angled on one side (so the umbrella is angled and the flash hits the center - this one is straight, so the flash hits off-center and isn't as efficient.So basically just about everything on this is broken, right?Not quite. It does have a redeeming quality and that's as a ballhead for your flash.Throw this on a superclamp, a lightstand, a tripod and use your flashes stand (or something like aStroboframe Accessory Shoeand only use it for a ballhead to angle your flash. For that, it works great! It's only when you try to use the included coldshoe, 1/4"" -> 3/8"" adapter or the umbrella hole that it has problems. This cheap-ballhead-for-a-flash is the reason I own 6, and for that I'd recommend it.",2,Negative
"Don't waste your time with this umbrella holder: The ballhead can not be tightened. No matter how hard you tighten the screw, it will still move around. Because of that the item is useless, unless you want to have your flash+umbrella uncontrollably moving around.",0,Negative
"I found this bracket to be rather flimsy and not really worth the money... The ball head is extremely loose, and good luck getting it to stay in one place. When I put anything heavier than just a flash on it, the ball head will sag in many positions, that includes a light weight shoot-through umbrella.

"Got this for a 22&#34; samsung. It fits, but we did reduce the size of the arms by an inch with a dremel to avoid seeing them. Chose this mount over the adjustable arm type because of mounting in drywall. It works, tv isn't going anywhere.",2,Negative
"I had a special purpose in mind for this mount and it is working just fine! I will say it was a pain in the ass to install, but that accounts for 1 percent of the user experience. I have mounted my television under the lid of a bench, so that the TV is hidden when the bench is closed. Even with the opening and closing of the bench, the TV hasn't moved, so I can only imagine how it would suit the needs of someone who plans to keep it stationary.",2,Negative
"The width of this product doesn't reach between the two studs.  You can mount one end of it on one stud and the other end of the mount will need to go into the sheet rock  Even though they give you plastic mollies, it is still in the sheet rock.The way I got around that is by mounting a 4&#34; wood board from stud to stud and then mount the &#34;designer habitat&#34; to the wood board.It took extra time and was a needless hassle.

"When I first opened the box I was impressed with how the quality appeared considering the cheap price.... but as I installed it, I discovered why it was so cheap.#1 the Screws it came with to mount it into studs are cheap, crappy screws that stripped out way too easy.#2 The entire frame broke on me as I tightened the rear allen screw.  The metal support frame literally cracked right in half.  See my pic:  [...]#3 The monitor mounting plate only rotates in 2 directions, yaw and pitch (from a plane-flying point of view), but it doesn't rotate in that 3rd axis (roll), it makes it hard to get your monitor to sit level.  Because the bracket is cheap, it's arms torque and twist a little, resulting in a monitor slanted slightly one direction or the other, even if the wall mount is 100% level.  You can only tighten the allen bolts more and hope it straightens out.#4 The included allen wrench used for tightening the allen bolts is far too short to get any decent leverage.  You need a longer ~5mm allen wrench to tighten them properly.Piece of crap.  RMA'ing immediately.",0,Negative
"Do the ""math"", or whatever it is, if you extend the arm out with a TV attached to it, it, or the joints, will realize the stress eventually and hang down. Not by much, but noticable.

If possible use a wall mount with a ball joint for twisting, but little or no extension for the straitest alinement, (straightest alignment, in Old English).",2,Negative

"The item was shipped by Amazon, so the box was well packed. The box for the mount was placed in another box. The mount is well built and mounting was easy. The instructions were a little sparse, but was adequate. It came with 3 sets of screws and washers for mounting to the TV. But it only had 2 sets of lock washers - the smaller size was used with either of the smaller screws. It also came with 6 lag bolts, washers and plastic anchors. The bolts were fine, but the plastic anchors were really low quality. The hardware arrived in 2 bags and does not match what is shown in the diagram.The built-in level was broken when I got it. There was no liquid in the level, and it was obvious that it did not break in transit since there was no stains on the box. There is no ""6-inch 3-axis magnetic bubble level"" included with the unit.I used it to install my 37"" TV with VESA 200x200 hole pattern. Once the TV was attached, the lower screws are used to prevent the TV from falling off the mount. If you tighten the screws even more, it would prevent the TV from sliding on the mount. Unlike the photo, there are tabs on the mounting plate that prevents the TV from sliding off the mount. The brackets that mount on the TV do not resemble the photos. There are no steel levers to lock the tilt mechanism - locking is done via plastic knobs. This is a much better design - the TV is well balanced on the bracket. The design in the photos would cause the TV to tilt downward and it would be difficult to adjust.The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is the broken level.",0,Negative
"I bought two sets to mount my PC screen on the wall.The purchase was done after reviewing the price and the fact the mount support VESA 100x200 with the additional bracket (the set also includes spacer...).The weight specifications are not good The mount itself will eventually support heavy screen (mine are heavy), but  the tilt mechanism at the screen (which allows rotation of the screen) is weak and heavy screen will be angled.  Bad/poor design.",2,Negative
"While it does work, it's not sturdy. It constantly comes out of the vent if you turn or reposition the GPS it comes out. So it's not much improvement on the suction cup that fell off.",2,Negative
This unit keeps your GPS where you need it.  I bought this product for a 3 week rental in Europe.  It seems to work fine for my wife and I but when my daughter joined us the unit kept falling off the vent.  She is somewhat of techie and does not have the soft touch of us old people.  After she left the unit never fell off again.  We also plan to use it for other car rental since we prefer this to the suction mount on the windshield.,3,Negative
"I normally travel with a windshield suction mount, and keep this mount as a backup, because of the problems I've had with this vent mount.  This vent mount frequently falls out of the vent, and the two clips at the top become deformed after a short time - losing their gripping power.  I'm not sure WHAT type of vehicle this thing would work good in, but it sure isn't my Hyundai or any rental car I've used when traveling.",0,Negative

"I bought this item for my iSymphony 27inch LCD tv and it works exactly as I predicted. Even though level indicator is spot on on the wall bracket, my tv appears to not be level.  Even with some minor adjustment, I can't seem to adjust for it. It may be that the riser washers for attaching the brackets to the tv are a bit to loose and the depth for the screws in the tv are a bit to shallow, however, this product did exactly what I needed it to do.",2,Negative
"This is a really solid TV mount. It comes with plenty of ways to screw it into a wall, which makes it a safe buy if you aren't sure of how far apart your wall struts are. The TV can unclip from the mount without having to remove the mount from the wall, so if your TV breaks or needs to be upgraded, you can leave the mount where it is and re-use it. The built-in level also makes it very easy to mount correctly.My only complaint is that it doesn't allow the TV to turn from side to side at all. It allows for a small degree of vertical tilt, but absolutely no horizontal tilt. Because of this, it's very hard to adjust for glare on the screen.",2,Negative

"Samsung has both the WMN2000C (reviewed here) and the WMN2000B ultra slim wall mounts.  The new 60"" UN60D8000 LED wasn't listed as a supported model in either descriptions so I used Samsung's online chat to ask a representative.  The rep confirmed that the WMN2000C would be compatible with the UN60D8000 LED TV.  She was wrong.  The kit comes with 2 sets of screws (a short set, or a longer set that can be used if the spacer is used to push the TV out an extra inch from the wall).  NEITHER set of screws is compatible with this TV due to the fact that the screwholes in the back of the UN60D8000 are recessed.  That means the both sets of screws are too 'short' to actually reach through the hook to the hole.  We ended up having to go to HomeDepot to find similar screws that we hacksawed down to size.  I see that the WMN2000B seems to list the D8000 LED series as a supported model, so I would suggest anyone with a UN60D8000 to avoid the WMN2000C and consider giving the WMN2000B a try instead.  One reviewer there seems to have indicated success using it with the UN60D8000.",0,Negative
"Based on the pictures and the description I decided to change course and buy an ""unconventional"" tv mount for my 60"" Samsung ultra-thin LED TV.  Big mistake.  I am very handy and I love home improvement projects.  When I opened up the box I had to stare at the directions for over an hour just to figure out how to install this mount.  In all fairness, the parts are very well made and they are packaged well.  I simply don't understand why there are absolutely no words in the directions.  Thats right, I said no words, only pictures.  Furthermore, the pictures are not accurate so I spent a lot of time fumbling around with parts that looked like they might have been correct.In the end, I was able to mount my tv with this kit but I was very unhappy with the result.  I wanted a certain amount of clearance between the entertainment console and the bottom edge of the television.  This kit makes it almost impossible to accomplish this task with any degree of accuracy simply because the wire used to hang the tv on the wall flexes.  In other words, you have no way of knowing how far down the tv will hang until you actually hang it on the wall.As if the lack of verbiage in the directions and the unknown amount of sag in the wire weren't enough to make me dislike this kit I discovered another problem.  When you look at the tv from the side you will notice that the tv does not hang straight on the wall.  It leans forward from the top down.  Just like.......wait for it..........a picture hanging on the wall.One last problem.  When you hang the tv on the wall using this mount it does not stay put.  The smallest bump of the screen will throw it off balance and then you are back to grabbing a bubble level to straighten it out.In the end I decided to return this and go back to the Sanus mounts I have been using for years.  I don't feel right hanging a $3000 television from a flimsy wire and 2 screws.  I would much rather take the time to mount the tv once, have it hang flat on the wall and not budge an inch when I finish the job.I think Samsung had a great concept with this mount but the execution is very poor in my opinion.",0,Negative
Mount works as needed but if you don't have a wooden backing you will need Drywall Anchors. My stud spacing is approx 24&#34; and I needed this in the middle of the spacing. Got TOGGLER 20-Pack Plastic Toggle 5/8-in to 3/4-in Drywall Anchor with #8 x 1-3/4-in Screws (might be a touch small) but got the job done. Only rating a 3 because of the lack of documentation of the large screw size. (assumed Metric #14) and the lack of drywall anchors being that most walls will not have stud spacing of 12&#34; or a cross beam to screw into where it is needed.I reused my LCD's (Dell 2709) mount screws as the washers included in the kit for a smaller VESA mount where almost too big and I didn't feel comfortable using them with the included washers.The built in level is nice.Pros:CheapWell builtQuick InstallCons:Poor Documentation about stud spacing and drywall use.No Drywall AnchorsWashers ID too large for small VESA screwsLack of screw size on the Large Plate Mount Screws (assumes Metric #13-14) took a metric #13 socket to tighten.,2,Negative

"This is a great mount if you are just looking to mount a TV. It is no frills, but really, do you seriously need all that tilt and swivel stuff? I know I didn't. The only issue I had with it was the mounting anchors. They were crap at holding onto the drywall. Fortunately I had some better anchors at my disposal. I only needed 1, as you really do want to make sure you are mounting to at least 1 stud. TV's are not super light&#8230; but you know this",2,Negative
"So the big draw of this mount is that its inexpensive.  It mounted my 32&#34; with no problem.  Mounted one side to stud and another view the in-wall plug and no concerns about staying on the wall.... so that is fineThe negative is that there is absolutely no adjustment of horizontal alignment with this thing.  Its very difficult to get it perfectly aligned horizontally, included level and all.  Once the TV is mounted, the eye is able to catch even a fraction of a inch of offset alignment, which the mount makes no provision to adjust.  If I had it to do over again, I'd have spent a little more and gotten with with post mount adjustment capabilities",0,Negative

"Most the people reviewing this mount didnt do their research.  Not all tv's have the same vesa pattern.  It would hold the weight of a 42 inch tv as long as the vesa pattern on the tv is within the specs of the mount.  It also mention its length, so those complaining it wont reach your studs should have read the product description.  I bought it for a 32&#34; in sceptre tv I wanted wall mounted in my work out room.  The sceptre ways about 25lbs,  I mounted it to 1 stud with two lag bolts and 4 heavy duty dry wall anchors that are rated to 265lbs each.  This mount inst going anywhere.  Also the bubble level on mine was actually accurate. It comes with some various hardware to mount the tv.  I didnt use any though.  Went to the hardware store and got some stronger hardware for about 2 bucks.  also since the mount is so small it doesnt block any ports my 32 inch sceptre.  The only negative i have is that one of the arms &#34;prongs?&#34;  that hang on the mount, was a little bent. I bent it back.  Cant complaing though,  I mean come on, it was $10.",0,Negative

"Recently I was looking to mount my Samsung TV (2011 D8000 series), and came across this little gem.  What a great find.  As long as you have no interest in tilting the TV or having it extend out from the wall, buy this now.  There is simply no other option that looks as amazing or is as easy to install.  The TV sits almost flush against the wall, and I can't wait for friends to come over and ogle at how beautiful it is.The mounts must be placed between 7 and 7.8 inches apart on your wall.  Of course, this means that at most, you can only use one stud (unless you happen to have oddly spaced studs where your TV is going).  On the box, it says to mount into 1/2"" drywall (implying that no studs are necessary), and if using 3/8"" drywall, use a stud.  I did a lot of research on drywall mounts, and was prepared to buy a set of Toggler SnapToggle anchors, which were the strongest ones I could find.  Turns out, the kit comes with a pair of exactly those kinds of anchors, and claims to be able to hold up to 440 lbs, with a safe working limit of 110 lbs (all the TVs this unit is designed for are much lighter than that).Still, I was nervous about mounting the TV to drywall only, especially since I live in a rented apartment in a relatively old building, and who knows what condition the drywall is in?  Luckily, there was a stud in exactly the right spot, so I was able to use one mount in stud and one mount in drywall, and I'm very comfortable with that.Yes, the directions are slightly confusing, but can be easily cleared up on YouTube.  I am very much an amateur when it comes to building stuff and mounting, and I had absolutely no problems with this.  The kit includes everything you will need to mount on either drywall, brick, or concrete.  I didn't look at the brick/concrete mount instructions, but if you're using drywall, you will need to drill a 1/2"" hole - your drill might only handle a 3/8"" bit, so check that you can either use a 1/2"" drill bit or borrow someone else's drill.  If you are installing into a stud, you should buy a good wood screw for that, but that's the only thing you might need to buy.The TV can either sit about 3/4"" away from the wall, or 1 1/4"" away.  There are spacers included in the kit if you want the further option - but those are your only two options.  I know some people had an issue with fitting their cables behind the smaller setting.  Personally, I had no problem, but if you have a lot of stuff hooked up or you're using exceptionally thick cables, you may need to go with the wider option.If you're planning on hiding the wires inside the wall, which I did not since I am in a rented apartment, cut out a hole in the drywall behind where the TV will be and run the cables up to it before you put the TV on the mounts.  It'll be a much bigger pain to get the cables behind the drywall if the TV is already up.",2,Negative
"This product works Okay, but if I had to do it over again ... I would not have gone there.  It was easy enough to install the product on the wall but a real bitch to hang the TV on it, (especially if you are doing it by yourself).  Unfortunately the worst part of using this product is when you need to make new connections ... you have to use a mirror to see your connections on the back of the TV.  It hangs like a big picture frame on the wall so ... without help ... you are stuck in Bizarro World !!!",0,Negative

"I bought this wall mount for my 42"" HD set.  It is a fine and acceptable mount -for the price point I bought at, hard to beat.  But be smarter than me, do not trust the ""integrated"" bubble level.  I trusted it.  It looked a little crooked, but I thought maybe it just LOOKED crooked.  It was way crooked.  The wife and I hung the set and it was comically bad.  It was so bad that I wish I had photographed my bubble level on top of the integrated bubble level.  When my level said it was straight (when it WAS straight) the integrated bubble level was at the right side stop -all the way right.  I wish that the level was not included, I put my trust in it.  Without it I would have taken the extra 40 seconds to grab my own level and I would not have put an extra couple holes in the wall -YES, I had to re-drill (it was that far off).Other complaint would be that the set screw (bottom rail hold-down screw) did not line up at all and go underneath the lower rail fully on one side.  I could have removed the set from the wall and straightened it out but I could screw it down enough to ensure it wasn't gonna fall off, it was good enough.So, bubble level sucks, overall QC pretty bad.  Quite sturdy though for the money.",0,Negative

"Look can be deceiving. I was nervous about mounting my 27"" flat screen on the wall with this, as the mount looks too simple. But after installation, I have no doubt that this simple, ingenous bracket is all I ever need. Since it use a single metal plate to hold the bracket, make sure you screw the place to a stud! To avoid drilling  many holes on my wall, I ran my stud finder several times to make sure I had a stud. Then installation is straight forward from then on. Highly recommended.",2,Negative
"I brought this device over to the home of one of my nephews, who has an LCD TV that he wanted to mount on his wall.  The mounting process is simple, as advertised, and it is low profile.  However, the problem with this wall mount is its limited range of tilt.  It's fine if you want to use it to get your TV off a piece of furniture and up onto the wall right behind it.  But it you want to mount the TV up higher out of the way, or off to the side, and expect to be able to tilt it into the proper viewing position, then this is not the mount for that purpose.  The tilt range just isn't there.  So although the device does what it's called in its description - a ""Simply Straight"" TV wall mount - it's functionality is limited to only that and don't expect more of it.",2,Negative
"Last year my wife and I decided to cancel our sports club memberships and instead make our own here at home in our basement. We had the machines (treadmill and an elliptical), the workout mirror -- even speakers for our iPods. But there was something missing that the sports club offered: A wall-mounted flat screen television.Enter the Philips Tilting LCD Wall Mount. Problem = solved.The wall mount was simple to install and now the old 32-inch flat panel that had been collecting dust in a guest room is back in use. Having the option to watch a workout video, a movie, the news... really takes the pain (most of it) out of working out. Two thumbs up for this product.",3,Negative
"This TV wall mount is one of the simplest mount I have seen on the market.  It is very light, and made up of just a few parts.  It includes screws for gypsum type board walls and direct to stud mounting.  Some TV mounts are big and just the weight alone makes me scared of installing it on a regular gypsum board wall.One of the things that is hard in installing a TV mount is how to make it level horizontally.  It is extremely annoying to drill holes and later realized that your TV is crooked to one side.  What do you do?  Drill more holes?  That is the main advantage of this mount, you don't drill more holes, you can just shift it with your hands even when the TV is already on the wall.  The TV practically rest on a rocker.  Watch the video to get the clear idea.The main disadvantage?  There is very limited tilt (up and down adjustments).",0,Negative
"Once you get this one-piece mounting bracket on the wall, the rest is relatively easy and it does work well and feel sturdy but getting it there is no easy task.There are no written instructions, just illustrations, and not very clear ones at that. It was mostly via trial and error that my husband and I figured out how, exactly, this worked. There is also no template--as is included with most mount systems, apparently--so the only way to measure and prepare screw positions is to hold the fairly heavy bar and lower latch system up to the wall; an awkward proposition that requires at least two people to accomplish.A last minute trip to the hardware store for us was also required as the included bolts, supposedly ""universal"" in design, didn't fit into our TV's mount. Whether this is the fault of the TV or the mount system, I'm not sure, but it definitely didn't make things any easier.I will also note that the large semi-circle mount bar shows just around the edges of our TV (especially when seen from the side; not straight on), which is at the minimum size for this mounting system.All in all, it took nearly three hours to install and was a relatively frustrating experience. Clearly written instructions and better-labeled parts (not to mention correct screw sizes) could have cut that time in half, at least.Once we finally accomplished that though, the TV does feel very well held and is easy to adjust and level. The hardware feels well-made and not at all cheap or flimsy. The one piece curved bracket attaches to the wall, while two heavy-duty bars affix to the TV. A specialized screw attaches to the bars (two available positions) and the whole thing hangs from the C-shaped bar (inside a channel), meaning that even once on the wall you can slide and tweak the position the TV, making absolutely precise positioning possible. All good things. In fact, with better instructions this would have easily been a four-star product for me. So two stars for the instructions and four for the final product, for an average of three.I would also add that this is a straight-across mount system with only very minor ability--via included plastic inserts of various sizes--to tilt, so if you need your TV to angle down, this probably isn't the mount for you.",2,Negative
"This worked out ok, but the screws that came in the kit were not long enough to mount the tv.  I finally had to use the screws that attached the tv stand.  Other than that it holds the tv very well and I can move it away from the wall to attach any accessories neccessary.",4,Negative
"This thing looks and works as-advaertised for its intended purpose.  Gets a three-star because the mechanism for setting the verticle angle requires two people (one to hold the TV, one to turn the cumbersome locking bolt).  Also - adjustment of the verticle tilt requires guesswork and the mark-1 eyeball.  A decent unit for the price - expect some adjustment pains.",2,Negative

"First off, for the price, this tv mount is very good. It has a very solid heavy-duty feel to it. I love the maneuverability of the arm. The only 2 frustrations with this mount was:1) one of the swivel tips was bent during shipping due to poor packaging. This probably could have been prevented either by pre-screwing the 2 parts together so that the tips would not be banging against everything during shipping or somehow wrap / protect the tips for shipment. I was able to straighten out the bent tip with a pair of pliers easily.2) The mount kit did not come with the 8mm screws needed for my Samsung tv. So I had to run to Lowes to grab a set of them in the middle of installation. No biggie...but an irritation if Lowes happens to be closed when you are installing this.",0,Negative
I received this as a defective product.  The box was damaged and so the holding bracket.  It also clearly says it was for smaller models.  I received a message from valuemax saying to  look for extension that clearly are not in the box.  I am frustrated and tired of having to repeatedly ask for a refund or exchange.  I just need the right model and it needs better packaging.,0,Negative

"one small, fatal flaw:  better make sure you get the mounting pins into the little holes in the back of your TV set ...  correctly THE FIRST TIME !  Otherwise, if you have to move or remove the mounting cradle for ANY reason,  you'll have to break the little plastic hooks on the pins.  Very thin, flimsy plastic hooks that SUPPORT THE WHOLE SYSTEM.  That is the annoying but fatal flaw.  Once you break the little hooks (which is VERY easy to do) the whole kit is useless.Think you can contact the mfg to ask for a couple more plastic hooks?  forget it!  they just ignore the request.Save your money .... and run some wire through the back of your TV's holes/slots,  and use the wire to attach the Apple TV unit just as firmly as this flimsy kit does.",2,Negative

"Product is ok, but check your use case first, I bought this before checking the back of my tv where we use the apple tv.The Vizio we have in the kitchen does not have any ventilation slots at all so the included mounting clips were of no use to me.I can either mount it  to the wall or use Velcro to the back of my tv - I am going to use the Velcro approach.The mount is not not of the highest quality plastic but it works for what we want to use it for.",2,Negative

"The Total Amount - Apple TV Universal Mounting Kit, works exactly as specified. It allows your Apple TV to be mounted either to the wall or the back of your television. In the case of television mounting, it comes supplied with a variety of clips that allow you to hang your Apple TV from the vents of your television. Having used the previous generation of Apple TVs which were significantly larger and heavier, I was initially skeptical about the idea of hanging it from my television. But when this mounting kit arrived, (in the same box as my new Apple TV) I was pleasantly surprised. The new generation of Apple TV's (which no longer have hard drives) are much, much smaller and lighter. Once I saw this, I no longer worried about hanging it from the television. In spite of it being behind the television, the Apple TV has no problem ""seeing"" the signal from the infrared remote.All in all, I am very satisfied with this device. I think $17 for a piece of cheap plastic is exorbitant, so I am knocking one star off my rating. In spite of this, it performs  precisely as the manufacturer claims, so I won't return it.",2,Negative
"I love my Apple TV. I use it every day. However, it's a small little thing... tiny compared to the other electronics sitting in the entertainment center... so hiding it seemed like a smart thing. And with TotalMount is WAS a smart thing.I was worried that I wouldn't have access to the IR of the AppleTV if I used this mount to clip it to the back of my flat screen, but it does, in fact, WORK.You get a many different types of mounting &#34;clips&#34; that can be used in a variety of different situations.  The unit also allows you to screw it into something - walls, cabinets, etc. So there are a myriad of different places and ways you can mount your AppleTV out of sight... or in sight...

I personally wanted it out of sight.I'm saving up the cash to buy another one for my bedroom where this is NO room on the dresser drawer to put things down on.",2,Negative
"works great to hang my apple tv behind my samsung TV, helps to de-clutter my entertainment center.  For the most part my remote still works by bouncing it off the ceiling and back behind the TV, but sometimes I forget and have to adjust my aim to get it right. no regrets though.",3,Negative
"Nice product, it hides the apple tv behind the tv, and its not seen, and its also reduces the cable mess from my desk.",1,Negative
"Unfortunately the AppleTV that I have requires line of sight with the remote, so if you use this mount to mount the Apple TV anywhere, your remote stops working. Heck, I even swear the remote works less with the bracket on as it covers the corners and sides. You are better off just purchasing some adhesive tape if you need to stick it in place.",0,Negative
"I used this for my 55' LG. Simple instructions, easy set up and install. Took me about 45 minutes to put this on my wall. I'm not very handy with such things and the wall attachment is a heavy item. The attached level is an added bonus... but the unit itself can be moved and tilted once the TV is hung which makes this pretty much idiot proof.The only reason I took a star away is due to the tilt tightener at the top of the TV bracket. It was difficult to reach once mounted to the unit. It is wedged too low between the mounted plate and the TV itself. I suppose it could be tightened off the mount... but that would make it harder to judge positioning.Overall, I'd buy it again.",0,Negative

For the price, this is incredible. I bought another one at Fry's for more money with less movement and returned it. The level on this mount isn't very accurate, but other than that I have no complaints. I've moved the tv without concerns about it falling off the wall or the mount.",2,Negative

"The Apple VESA adapter is typical of Apple stuff... finely milled of aluminum, and probably somewhat over-engineered.  The instructions are a little cryptic, but I quickly found a YouTube video that described how to release the stock stand hinge and mount the VESA mount -- a process that involves no fewer than 8 tiny screws.  Once in place, the mount worked fine with my Ergotron Workfit workstation.",2,Negative
I purchased an arm to hold up my iMac.  When I received it I discovered I required an adapter plate to attach the arm to the computer.  Final result is they don't make an adaptor plate (supra) that works with the arm.  I returned both and was charged a $25.00 restocking fee by the makers of the arm.  A telephone conversation with the makers of the arm revealed they knew no one makes an adapter kit for the iMac to fit their arm.,0,Negative
"Quite possibly the worst designed product that I have ever purchased from Apple. Quality control is either lacking in production or Jonny-Ive had a few too many beers at lunch on the day this was designed.The Adapter plate must be screwed down so tightly by a center screw prior to attaching the two beefy side screws that really hold the plate to the monitor, that you are guaranteed to strip the head with the cheesy torx wrench that is supplied. After sending back my first one after I stripped out the center torx screw when attempting to mount onto my late 2010 27-inch iMac, and reading comments on the Apple store, I found the easy solution to this problem: remove the two grey plastic strips that run along the edge of the adapter plate that sits against the iMac. This provides the extra millimeter or so that you need to get the center screw down tight enough to get the side bolts in.Also pay very close attention to the side bolt mounting holes. I first screwed down the center screw to hand tight with a torx driver and then slowly fed one of the side bots in by a few turns. Next, I gently rotated the entire plate to realign the other hole for the other side bolt. Once you have both side bolts mounted by a few turns then you can keep SLOWLY screwing down the center screw and then finish threading the side bolts in. Lastly, once your iMac is mounted to your monitor arm / video mount, you can carefully slide the plastic strips back into place, or simply cut them down to smaller lengths so they can slip on and protect the back of the iMac. Honestly though, the worst that will happen is you will scratch the back of your iMac some, but who stares at the back of their iMac??",0,Negative

"Needed some new shelves for my entertainment setup.  Didn't want anything super fancy and definitely didn't want a super fancy price tag.  Ordered three of these.  One of them was bent funny, or so I thought, out of the box.  Not sure why, but it had a decent lean on it instead of sitting level.  Amazon got me a replacement and noticed the same thing.  I bent the bracket slightly to get the legs to sit level and boom.  The reason for four stars is the covers that are supposed to hide the wires.  They barely clip on and stay.  I'm using them to hide the bolts and don't think you could hide wires behind them and have them stay on.  Keep that in mind when ordering.  I ran all my wires in the wall",0,Negative
"got one of these shelves because I wanted something inexspensive to use a CPU holder on the side of my desk. I first cut about 8 inches off each arm and then put the caps back on. then I bolted it to the side of my metal desk... I felt very very solid, ( could probably use it as a step in a pinch, don't try this on one that's not cut down it would probably bend not break). I didn't use the plastic piece because I wanted the cpu closer to the desk, then I used a bungee cord to hold the computer in place. a lot cheaper than anything I could find on the net. maybe not the most beautiful thing but it works and puts the computer where I wanted itsaggman54",2,Negative
"I have a number of monitor desk stands like this one, and in some instances, I only have one monitor on them as having a dual monitor setup at every desk is a budget luxury. In most cases, I can keep just one monitor on a stand and it balances well; in this case, the stand tipped and I need to use a box to prop up the other side until I can add the additional monitor. Instructions aren't great, either, luckily, it doesn't have a lot of parts to it so it's manageable.",2,Negative
Much more flexible than those that don't gave moving arms but slide left and right. I highly recommend this product.EDIT: I found one big issue - the axle that spins the monitors from portrait to landscape orientation is not tention adjustable. It is 'sealed hub' don't know what else to call it. After a week of use it is already loose and. Some times its a problem to position the monitor upright. This will be a big problem if you have heavier monitors. Its a shame since everything else is adjustable and solid.Dropped 2 stars for this weak point. If you need to rotate your monitors daily look somewhere else or you have to modify this one.,2,Negative
"Given the price, this is a surprisingly good stand.  It is missing many of the adjustment instructions but you can figure it out.  One of the plastic wire guides broke out of the box, but given that I'm not using them anyway I don't really care.  The key thing is to know that you have to remove the plastic caps at the monitor holder of each arm to tighten the bolt to stop the up-down tilt from being too loose and causing the monitors to flop all over, at least on mine out of the box.",2,Negative
"I bought this for my two 23"" Acer H233H LCD monitors.  Setup instructions were very simple to follow (and they clearly state that the bolt is optional...  not sure how people are misunderstanding it and scratching their desks).  I had the same issue some people reported where the monitors tilted down once I attached them to the VESA plates, but I was able to tighten it down no problem.  The bolts to tighten for vertical tilting are located under the outer bolt cover on each plate.  The cover pulls off easily with your fingernails or a screwdriver.The length of the arms are not adjustable, so you will have to swing the monitor arms toward you if you need to close the gap between monitors.  The pictures also don't do justice to how epically enormous the monitor stand base is.  It's over a foot deep  and a foot wide, so make sure you have some room on your desk.  Still, it takes up much less room than the stacks of books the monitor stand replaced for me.  I'll be drilling a hole and bolting the pole onto the desk, which will allow me to get rid of the base.The cable organizer clips on the back have just enough room for two power cables and three video cables, in case you want your monitor to take two different inputs.  More cables can be routed through it, but the the clip will likely not snap closed.  The clips running under each arm were a little smaller, but still able to hold a power cable and two video cables.",2,Negative
"As others have noted, the bottom nut is specifically only to be used (not that it is not needed, but it should not be used unless) if you are clamping through a hole in the desk. The desktop mount instructions say to not use that bottom bolt, and to instead use three screws on top of the foot that hold the vertical post in place.Most low star review here are people saying that the swivel (at the monitor mount location) is not tight enough and the monitors fall down to face the desk. The fix to this is very simple, but sadly the included instruction booklet is not clear at all. In order to access the tightening nut (wrench is included in the box), you have to pop off the entire outside plastic cap, which is nearly 1/2&#34; wide. Don't try to pop off what looks like just a small circular cover piece about 1/8&#34; thick - that piece isn't a piece. The entire end is a large plastic cap. There is plenty of room to insert a flat screwdriver between the metal arm and the plastic cap and pop it right off. Then you can access the tightening nut and prevent your monitor from laying down!",2,Negative
"This stand does what it is supposed to do. It is a bit of a pain to adjust, but I've never met a multi-monitor stand that wasn't a pain to adjust. The base is adequate, if a bit large. I have no worries that the monitors will be falling over.",2,Negative
item was as pictured and does work. I gave it 4 starts because it is made of thinner metal. it doesn't seem like it will break but it does droop a little. but you can compensate that with the tilt. I decided to visit Lowes and got some additional items to use to mount it to the wall. I used some steel flat bar that I bolted to the studs on ether side and than 1/4&#34; butterfly nuts through them to mount it to the wall. This was also partly done because there wasn't a stud right where I wanted to mount it. I have a 37&#34; Sharp LCD mounted on it.,2,Negative

"It holds my tv well. It didn't fit perfectly, though. One of the sides that goes on the actual TV I couldn't get to screw down all the way. Also, it blocks some of the ports for things. However, it does its job and that's holding my TV on the wall.",0,Negative
"I needed a bracket that had really long vertical arms that offered the most adjustments for a 39&#34; TV. This bracket fit the bill. I still have room to go lower, i have used this bracket to mount a TV 1 brick row above a fireplace opening (the fireplace is no longer and will never be used again. The reason i gave it 4-starts, is because it includes 3 Lag bolts, i put the bolts on the left side and the right side as well as one in the middle, the hangers that clip onto that bracket which are in turn mounted to the TV each fall in between middle and outer bolts (as it should) the problem is that the hanger is bending the bracket just a tiny bit out and away from the bricket resulting in the TV tilted so slightly. This is fixed by grabbing a tap screw and putting in one more bolt right where the hangers sit or you could wedge a small piece of paper folded up under neath the hanger, thats a weird way of bringing it back up but just a thought.",0,Negative
You must plug in everything before hanging the tv on the wall.  I was able to do the whole job myself.  I almost had help from my 4 yr old but he couldn't unscrew the base mount from the tv and my patience was running low trying to hold the tv.,1,Negative
"these held my 50&#34; plasma up with no issues. slim profile so if you have large cables that need to be behind the TV, then these may not be the best choice.  maybe about 2&#34; clearance between the wall and the tv with these.

"I purchased this for the purpose of mounting a Toshiba Thrive to my tripod for use as a controller and focusing monitor for my HD DSLR video rig.  Since this is not made specifically for this use, I had to convert it to a flat mount by cutting off the right angled piece of the bracket with a Dremel tool, and then drilling four holes through which I run two u-bolts to fasten the assembly to my tripod upright.The biggest issue, as I see it, is that the gooseneck is not centered in the tablet mounting frame, and the frame cannot be sufficiently tightened to the gooseneck to keep it from seeking the lowest point when you mount a largish tablet to it.  What this means, specifically, is that my 10"" Thrive did not rest at a proper horizontal orientation when mounted - rather, it spun such that it was oriented diagonally and was useless to me.  I had to fix this by spot welding the mounting bracket to the tripod.  This is obviously not something I would recommend to most users of this mount, but it worked just fine for my use.That said, this is an extremely sturdy mount now that I have welded the bracket to the gooseneck to prevent it from rotating, and the gooseneck itself will hold virtually any position you can force it into.This product is a bit of a paradox, but with the proper modifications, works exactly as I need it to.",0,Negative

"I was debating how to review this unit. On the wall mount alone, or on the kit as a whole. I opted for the latter, so for those who are in it for the mount only, good news: The mount is fine, works well, and comes with all the screws you'll need for your TV and wall mounting needs, even some spacers for low profile TV's.The bad: The HDMI cable sucks. Now, I rarely buy something because it &#34;comes with goodies,&#34; but in my case, I moved into a new home and new I would need a few HDMI cables. So my options came down to this mount, or another slightly better rated mount at the same cost that did not come with a HDMI cable. I figured why not save $5 and buy this unit instead, saving me the cost of getting an HDMI cable by itself.When I first wired everything up, I could not get my Roku to work. I began troubleshooting and finally narrowed it down to the HDMI cable. Swapped cables with another, and it worked. I hooked the HDMI cable that came with this kit to my PS3, and it worked with the PS3, until I tried playing a 3D movie, then the picture crapped out again. Even though description claims the cable is rated for 3d (v1.4) it wouldn't work.Either way, I tossed the cable. I should note I've never come across a &#34;bad&#34; hdmi cable before. I've even used older specd cables for 3d without issue, so I was surprised this one was having so much trouble. Perhaps I just got a bad one, and in fairness I did not give the manufacturer the option to replace it, because it would just be more hassle than it's worth to try and return the kit, or even just the cable.Bottom line: Buy this kit for the mount, but don't buy it if you need the included HDMI cable.",0,Negative

"I bought this item after reading all the glowing reviews.... which now makes me suspicious since they all just too sounding-alike for all the similar products. But here is what you get in the package: 2-PIECE, yes 2-piece of the horizontal bar that need to be joined in the middle by a plate using 4 screws and the vertical bars that can barely hold up if they were propping up a little coffee table. I was going to mount my hefty 42-inch vizio plasma circa 2006 that weighs over 80 pounds and I immediately put the item back into the box (very hard to do after you get it out) upon seeing these flimsy metals. I suppose if you have a newer light-weight LED TV that is no more than 30-40 lbs you can probably do alrite, but this is just not for me, especially after I see the metal-joining trick you must do to make it work.... Buyer beware",0,Negative
"I read all the reviews before I opted for this mount. I'll give it that it's a beefy unit, but that's all. It was missing the allen wrench, but all the fittings required a phillips screwdriver. It was missing a spacer for the screw size for my TV. Missing parts is an automatic 1 star for me; that's inexcusable. The tilt mechanism is very sticky; not a smooth operation at all). The mounts that attach to your TV are in two pieces and when bolted together, still have some play in them. Bolting the main frame together is no big deal, but I gotta tell you, this is the bottom of the barrel. Once it's up and mounted, just forget about it.Post-Install UPDATEI found a solution for the missing parts and completed the installation. Once mounted this bracket serves its purpose well. Big credit for providing wall anchors that also can be screwed in with a phillips head. I drilled the holes slightly larger, put WD40 on them and they sunk smoothly. This was for a 32"" TV, but this mount can easily handle the larger screens. The seller responded immediately on the missing parts, so overall I've upped my rating. My only reason not 5 star is the 2-part TV mounts and lack of smoothness in the tilt feature. What would make this thing rock would be a horizontal tilt adjustment post-install in case you have any issues with leveling after you've mounted the wall bracket. Would not be hard to do; could just be a screw on the top of arm that would push down on the wall frame.",0,Negative
I have 50 inch samsung plasma and the fit from the bracket to the mount via the width is just a tad too small.  The parts are very low quality with powder black finish.

It has nuts and bolts to combined them for larger TVs, but it still was not big enough for the Panasonic.  Also the brackets that attached to the TV come in 2 pieces and have to be put together.  This bracket is not worth it when you can spend a few extra coins and not have all the extra work.",0,Negative

Use it and hide the cables.For use with an IR only Roku (meaning one that doesn't use the game remote or a non-Roku 3 model), may require mounting it to the TV or the wall to get it high enough to see the IR signal bounced off the ceiling or other surface.

"We hire these folks to install our new 50&#34; Panasonic flat screen. They made prior contact and scheduled a visit at my convenience. They called and advised us they were coming and arrived when scheduled. Two men installed the set in my bedroom where I wanted it but I didn't realize until they left they used bolts that were too long. The bolt ends protruded thru the wall into the master bath pushing the medicine cabinet about an inch from the wall. In addition, they cracked the inside of the cabinet and left a screw inside the medicine cabinet sticking out about an inch.I phoned the number they left me and spoke with several folks who were courteous and apologetic. They promptly sent someone to my home to survey the damage and then promptly sent two men out to remedy the problem. They used bolt cutters to shorten the screw and replaced my broken cabinet with an identical unit they bought at the store where I purchased my original.We always hope things go perfectly but when they don't, it's nice to deal with people that stand behind their work.",3,Negative
"First review of this product.OK, why 5 stars when I returned it?Because the Play70 is a very well-engineered and high quality piece of hardware.But... it was not the best solution for my bedroom and TV.I ended up with a ceiling mount. This was only because my wall was short and there were no studs available in the only place I could mount the Play70.However, things to know about the Omnimount --It is big and heavy.31 pounds.You may need two people to handle this.The wall mount plate alone is 14 inches high by 4 inches wide.You must measure carefully before installing this to the wall.The reason is the mount cannot be adjusted until after the TV is mounted onto it.And from a practical standpoint, you cannot mount the TV to the VESA plate until after the mount is installed to the wall.So you have no way to &#34;eye ball&#34; how it will look with the TV added until after you have committed and screwed in the mount to the wall.Study the Omnimount website as they have dimensional drawings you can study with measurements.The offset is about 20 inches horizontal. In other words, the wall mount for the arm will be 20 inches away from the VESA plate, on which your TV is attached.So if you want your TV centered when it's fully retracted, you need to install the mount 20 inches to the side of the final TV resting place.Vertical placement is not as critical since the mount can move a TV up and down keeping the horizontal distance consistent as it moves.One good thing is the mount itself and the wall mount as well will be hidden behind the TV if your screen size is 50 inches or larger. This is a key consideration.There is no question the mount can hold as much as 77 pounds. You adjust the tension by turning screws. Once adjusted properly, the movement is very smooth.The TV will stick out about 7 inches from the wall even when pushed fully back to the wall, so this not a slim profile. You can pull out the TV about 24 inches from the wall.You can rotate the TV down, up, left, right, in any direction you want.Again, this is a very nice piece of equipment and the force tension works well. Just know that the piece itself is large and heavy and mounting to a stud is critical.",2,Negative
"I don't have the lightest flat panel in the world, but my Visio 42in seems to do fine on this wall unit. I adjusts easily and with lag screws into wood stud, this unit is very solidly attached to the wall. I would even consider another for other rooms.",1,Negative
"The OmniMount PLAY 20 installed easily into a single stud.  No problems with the lag bolts or mounting the wall plate.  The TV mounting plate had perfect left to right and up and down spacing, but it did not have the correct length screws for mounting to a Samsung 29 inch.  There were three sets of screws/bolts included but none worked, either they were too big in diameter or too short.  One trip to the hardware store and 4 dollars later I had two differnt lengths of screws/bolts and the longer ones worked just fine.  The instructions called for a part that was not included in my bags of parts.  It is called a threaded cap.  The bolt that is supposed to thread into the cap was included but no cap.  I contacted Omnimount and did an online chat.  As near as the rep, me and the others at OmniMount could figure, the mounts are coming with new instruction pages but they are still shipping the older mount hardware  package.  The older mount does not come with a threaded cap.  It is not a big thing but it did suck up an hour of my time with online chats, and repeatedly checking the boxes for a part that was not there.I think a nut and a couple of washers will work just fine, or not worry about it and leave it out completly, as the older version dis not have this additional part.This mount still works well for me, but one needs to seriously visulalize how it moves to be able to figure if it will work for your situation.  I deducted one star for lack of proper hardware.  This will be used for small TV mountings and the screws/bolts supplied were not suitable.  I'd buy it againregardless.",0,Negative
"I am writing this because I read comments about only concrete or wood attachment. I myself had no problems. Simply marked my holes, drilled and inserted wall anchors for drywall that I had. The only thing I would suggest is getting some right angle HDMI connectors.",0,Negative
"I was looking for a cheap articulating mount for a Samsung PN60E6500 plasma tv...  I wanted a mount that would be able to be positioned at a verticle tilt, but didn't need to be moved after the initial install, so an expensive Omnimount or Peerless mount wasn't needed.Opening the box, I discovered that the attached plastice bubble level was crushed and useless... No biggie, since it wasn't a selling point for me. I used mu own bullet level to install.  The unit comes fully assembled except for the VESA brackets for the TV.  Since th unit is like 28 lbs, I used the provided allen wrench to uncrew the mounting place from the arms... not sure why it ships assembled when it's easier to install  the plate without the arms attached (as well as using a level on the top.I noticed how cheap the lagbolts were and used my own, tossing the cheap ones.  There's no reason to twist a head off to prove they are bad as they look and feel.  After mounting the plate and reattaching the arms the unit is installed.  Befor attaching the adjustable brackets to the plasma, I tested their attachment to the arm plate.  Thankfully I did this before trying to setup the TV on them.  The M6 security screw is too short to effectively lock the TV arms in place... So I used a 1"" longer M6 screw (metric) and then it worked fine.For one of the cheapest mounts of this type out there.. its worth the terrible hardware issues, but it only gets 3 stars because I didnt trust the cheap lags and had to go buy 2 M6 screws that would actually lock in the tv to the mounting plate.  Once the TV was installed, it positioned the TV perfectly and I used the uncluded Allen wrenches to tighten up the arms.You get what you pay for, but the pain was expected at this price and bottom line, the product works with a two dollars of replacement parts.Edited to add a few notes:  This is a mount that requires 16"" OC stud position.  it's mounting plate will not support 24""OC studs.",0,Negative
"I bought this to hang a 50 inch tv in a corner. The set weighs about 40 lbs. Not a super heavyweight, but not too light when extended out either. With only a little muscle, my girlfriend and I (both in our 50s, btw.) were able to hang this bad boy. I took half a star because a template would be extremely helpful.I did literally fry my TV and DVR when trying to attach the HDMI cable. I don't know if it was the cable, or the TV. (Both were new. The cable came with the mount.) Just so you know...Again, I don't know which was bad. The cable, or the TV. I ended up returning the TV, and buying a new cable.",2,Negative

It was very easy to set up and install on the TV all the bolts and screws were with it.(Very uncommon) In 15 minutes the TV was on the wall! It's made of heavy steel and it rigid.

"The product works, it will hold a TV on the wall, and even allow it to tilt 15 degrees. Installation is only slightly more difficult than a mount with a solid backplate, which is to say not that difficult if you have a very basic understanding of hand tools and wall construction.This is a quality product, it is a simple design, that is about all there is to say about it. Is it as easy to install as it would be if you called a professional to have it done? No, it isn't, it is much more difficult than that, but if that is what you are looking for there are probably several pages of companies in your local yellow pages willing to help you out.If you don't understand how walls are built, this and every other wall bracket is going to be a challenge to install, but that isn't because of a bad design, that is because of your lack of skill and knowledge. If you are on the fence about tackling this project and are worried about the quality of the product, don't be, the product is fine, if you are on the fence because you aren't sure you are capable, then have a pro do the job, a poorly installed wall mounted TV is dangerous to people and the TV set.The only issue I have with the instructions and packaging is that it comes with concrete anchors and the instructions specify that this bracket should be installed on a concrete wall or solid hardwood wall, that is their way of escaping liability if the customer can't find studs in a hollow wall. That is a bit of a cop out, and they used it to avoid adding information on how to locate and attach to studs, which I guess I can understand, but understandable or not it is still a cop out, so minus one star.",0,Negative
"I was wary about buying this mount at first.  But I thought I could make it work, because I've mounted at least 20 flat screen TVs with all kinds of different mounts.  I thought I could save a few bucks, because I had to mount 2 TVs in the kids room.  Well, I should have gone with gut instinct, and bought something better.  This is &#34;PREMIUM&#34; mount is the worst product I've ever installed.This mounting bracket set is misleading in product description.  Most house have longer than 16&#34; studs for inside walls.  You may get lucky and be able to find a spot where builder left 2 studs close enough to mount one of the plates.  However, if your TV is anything larger than 32&#34;, you will likely have a longer than 16&#34; spread between the mounting holes on the back of your TV.  Then you will HAVE to install both of the wall plats, because a single one would not hold it.  Good lucking finding 3 studs so close together for you to mount 2 both plates.  Also, the spacing between the 2 wall plates is so wide, you will NOT be able to get them to fit on the same 2&#34; wide stud.In short, this mounting set is NOT good for small TVs on interior walls, and NOT good for large TV bigger than 32&#34;.  Only way to make it work is to put some screws in drywall anchors, which is not safe for large screen TVs.I was able to make it work by bolting the 2 wall plates on some scrap metal, but it was more trouble than the few dollars I saved buying this.  If you are shopping for a mount, go with a single wall plate model, and spend the extra money.",2,Negative
"The only reason this wall mount didn't get a perfect 5 stars is that the main body of the mount was in 2 pieces that wasn't long enough to mount between 2 studs, we ended up having to buy some 1X12 to mount first...no biggy, but slightly inconvenient.",0,Negative
Instead of a one piece mount to the wall it comes with two pieces that you have to level independently which is a challenge. The brackets that go on the back of the tv weren't milled the same so we had to bore out the hole so it would align properly.,0,Negative
"So I partially blame myself, because if you look at the picture, there is a vertical ""seam"" in the center of the bracket. I assumed (first mistake) that this was part of the folding / stamping process of the steel. It really does appear to be a single piece of steel.However, it's not. It's another one of those awful two piece brackets with a left and a right half. The problem with this is that it increases installation time. Typically what is done, is the bracket is lined up with 12 or 16"" on center studs, one hole is pre-drilled, and a 13mm head lag is driven in 90% of the way. Then use a mag level to square it off, drill the other holes and impact in the remaining lags - then tighten to bubble level.Not with two piece brackets. With these, you can't just hold it because it's two pieces, meaning you have to do this work twice. On top of that, each piece is smaller than standard 16"" ctc studs, so if you don't want the steel to bend outwards as the TV is sliding left/right for positioning, you have to use toggle bolts or similar. Toggle bolts can potentially add another 15 - 30 minutes to a job, and if the customer has "" or thicker drywall on top of plaster?  Just hope you brought toggle bolts long enough.The two piece brackets work on standard stud bays, they really do. But it takes extra effort, extra hardware, and extra time. The extra time is the killer and I will never be purchasing this piece of junk again. Only buy single piece brackets!",0,Negative

"We just got two new flatscreens in the house around Christmas, so I ordered two of these because of the low price.

My only complain is the cable management system doesn't work very well.",1,Negative
This shelving unit is easy to install and level with the correct tools. It takes about 45 minutes the first time and 15 minutes if you have done it before. The shelves are made for medium to small electronics and the wires cannot be hidden in anyway. If you have lots of wires then I must suggest a different solution because it will look very bad on your wall. The shelves easily tilt with pressure even when the adjustment screws are very tight. The wood screws that attach the unit to the wall are too cheap and strip easily. My goodness they could have sent hardened steel lag bolts at least. I had to buy them at the hardware store as the screw heads all failed as if butter. The rubber washers broke and there was only one extra.,1,Negative
Easy to install but if you are looking to hide several cords this unit will not do that.  The cord area is a very small area along both sides of the base.  The shelves look nice - but my cords are still all over and unattractive.,1,Negative

"I bought this to mount a PS3 under a flat screen that I mounted to the wall using a pivoting mount. As purchased the shelf clamps were not big enough to clamp onto the PS3. I purchased longer bolts to rectify the issue and it has worked fine. It is more stable and solid than I expected. I attached it to the wall stud using the included hardware, though I don't think I'd trust it to hold my PS3 using the drywall mounts. It does fold down flat, but that is not something I take advantage of in the design. Also be aware that depending on your input/outputs it may interfere with how your device sits on the mount. For example the HDMI port on the PS3 almost prevents the device from mounting all the way to the rear of the mount.",1,Negative
"Something I didn't know when I bought this was that it can lay flat against the wall when not in use!! This was a huge plus for use because it is in my wife's preschool room and the kids could bump it if it where sticking out.  It was easy to put up and holds our Panasonic 210 - the only problem is that the HDMI port on our player is in the middle of the back which is where the hinge is, so I scooted it forward and we are good to go.

"Works Perfect with a Panasonic GT30 50"" TV & a Panasonic SU-HTB520 Soundbar.

"For one, I used it on my 42 inch vizio, & my 42 inch vizio sound bar. Problem was, this bracket wasn't adjustable at all & kept having the speaker cover of my sound bar pushing against the bottom of my T.V.

Unfortunately I was unable to find a bracket specifically for my VizioTV that would mount my VIzio sound bar. Read some reviews on this product and was concerned it may not fit just right. People were saying the sound bar mount holes didn't fit correctly because of the current bracket/stands on the sound bar. I was able to connect them both up in a matter of a few minutes. Ten minutes tops.The Vizio sound bar worked with this bracket by mounting upside down under the tv. Some people may have issues with this but it really didn't matter to me. Works flawlessly and I no longer have this sound bar sitting off to the side. Sound goes wherever my tv goes on it's swivel.,2,Negative

"I used the Sewell Universal Soundbar Bracket to mount my Samsung soundbar below my LED TV.  It came with everything I needed to mount the bracket to the back of the TV but I had to go to Home Depot to pick up two sets of nuts and bolts to mount the sound bar's mounting plate to the bottom of the bracket.  Once I had everything hooked up, the sound bar stayed in place and hasn't moved since.  The bracket felt stable with the sound bar mounted at the bottom of the TV.  Can't comment on how it would hold the sound bar above the TV.  I was worried at first that it might be flexible due to it's thickness but I was wrong.  I recommend this bracket to anyone looking to mount their sound bar below their flat panel TVs.",2,Negative
"Using it on a 24&#34; tv for a couple months now. We rotate the tv to face either the dining room or front room.Construction is very sturdy.I think I substituted two of my own heavier duty lag bolt screws for the ones they provided (for the wall attachment).One drawback is that the plate that slots into the back of the TV leaves a tiny bit of space (in other words, wobble room).You have to get this mounted really level because there is no rotation clockwise or counterclockwise as you face the TV.Good for the price.",0,Negative

I will be purchasing two more of these for other rooms after finding out this is exactly the mount I want.  Two words of caution, 1.) don't trust the built in level, mine was at a 45 degree angle when I received it.  Not sure who they hired to glue on the level part but it might as well not be there.  2.) You have to install the up/down tilt thumb screws before you mount it on the wall.  It doesn't say it in the directions but after mounting the TV the first time and trying to figure out why it wouldn't stand up I realized the screws were not attached from the factory.  Seems stupid, but then again  I look at the level not being level.  Overall for the price, I can live with those two issues and will purchase again.",0,Negative
This is a great wall mount for the price. its is very sturdy and can hold much more than my 70 lb plasma t.v. if you find it's too tight to extend out or turn sideways fear not ! you can loosen the nuts on the arms and that will make it easier to adjust swivel or tilt. my mistake was I forgot to check the TV's  vesa pattern (distance between holes on the back of tv ) i.e. width and height . so I had to return the first one I bought because of wrong vesa pattern. shame on me! only one bad thing to say is don't trust the level bubble on the frame as it maybe off.,2,Negative
"There are probably at least 500 wall mounts out there that are all extremely similar to this one if you browse Amazon.  This is the only one that's 1) inexpensive and 2) has a wall plate bigger than 18&#34;.  Why oh why do manufacturer's make their wall plates 18&#34; when studs are minimum 16&#34; apart? That means that you have very little flexibility on where you mount the wall plate, never mind trying to install it if you have studs 24&#34; apart.  Sure, you can slide the tv arm bars on the tv plate, but that causes lopsided weight distribution, which then causes the tv plate to not be level.  A few observations on installing this plate:1) Even with the 27.5&#34; plate, I find that I cannot perfectly center the mount on my wall.  I have to offset it and slide the tv to one side.  If you have a smaller tv, this means that your wall plate will be exposed and not hidden from view.2) Just because the wall plate is level, doesn't mean that your tv is level.  My tv was 10 degrees off after mounting.  You can adjust the level of the tv plate with 5 screws but it is very inaccurate.  Just tightening the screws can throw off your level.  So you have to hold your tv in the level position you want, all while trying to tighten the screws to make it hold.3) Sideways movement is fairly smooth.  Up tilt is smooth.  Down tilt is not.  No different than most under $200 mounts.4) No washers provided for the screws for the wall plate.  Had to get some from Home Depot.5) HDMI cable is low quality.6) The level on the mount seems to be accurate.  I used another level to install but it seemed to confirm that the mount was level.All in all, a very good mount for the price with a few minor issues.",0,Negative

"I have to give this mount only 2 stars.I will start with the good:1. Cable run for wires through the tube2. Nice finish3. Very configurableNow to the negatives:1. The room for the wires between the mounting bolts and the inside of the tube is pretty small. Do not expect to run many or any larger wires as you have to have room for the bolts to go through the middle of the tube.2. One of the corners on the ceiling mounting base was bent. I can deal with this as I was able to work it back flat with out cracking the finish.3. Mounting lengths not flexible enough on the lower sizes. While this may not be an issue if you have 10 foot ceilings, with the 8 foot ceiling you either have to choose between right up next to the ceiling or roughly 18"" down. This puts the projector right about where the top of my head is. I am really not considering this as a full negative as it only really applies to those with 8' ceilings or that have a ceiling fan in the middle of their room which keeps them from hanging it close to the ceiling.4. While trying to tighten up the bracket as a whole (where the pole goes into the ceiling bracket) I noticed that the width of the base plate arms and the tube are enough different that when you put in the ""upper bolt"" it loosens the lower bolt. The bracket ends up coming toward the tube at an angle. Even with what I felt was excessive tightening, the tube is still loose in the bracket.5. THIS IS THE BIG ONE... If you look at the picture of the item, you will notice the bracket that attaches to the projector. The issue I am having is that the connection between that middle plate and the ball joint that allows for swivel is a pressure joint. There are a couple of problems with this design. The one I have is loose. This was making it near impossible to get the projector to stay aimed. Every little vibration in the ceiling (front door closing, Sub woofer pounding) caused the projector to move slightly. I was able to take the plate apart and pound on that pressure fitting a bit to get it tighter but it is not solid still. The only fix I can see (other than replacing it) would be to take it apart, drill out the pressure fitting and tap the hole to put a machine screw in. The second issue with this is that I can see with the extra movement it could eventually loosen up over time to the point where it would allow the projector to drop. So do not mount a heavier projector to this mount.6. The screws for tightening up the ball joint tend to grab on to the joint and twist it while tightening up. I had to place the projector in an un-aimed position and tighten it up. Then, if it over shot the final spot (or under-shot) I would have to start over. It took quite a while to get the projector aimed just right.Finally, I would like to address another review on here. The other reviewer warns away from this mount for Acer projectors. This is due to the small spacing between the mounting holes on the projector. In case you do not heed the rest of this review and go ahead and purchase this mount, I will attempt to explain how to get the mount to work.They provide an extra set of legs for the part where you mount the projector. If you take those and replace the longer ones and turn them backward so that they point in toward the middle, this will space them just right for the screw holes on the Acer.Good luck with this mount, you may need it.*EDIT*I was recently contacted by a representative of the company. I was impressed by their professionalism and prompt response to my feedback. Since the contact from the company does not fix the issues with the mount, but they are working on redesigning the product, I will bump this up by one star.",0,Negative
"about 30 minutes to put it up and get the projector on it, maybe less. only problem is the adjust screw is a pain, getting this thing to set just right where i needed it took a lot more time.",0,Negative
"Don't get tricked by those small images. I was impressed how large this item actually is. I only needed the smallest length and there was this huge telescope arm within, even with cable hole.However, while unpacking I was at 5 stars while beeing happy how complex and huge this thing first looked, but when mounting it to my projector I have had to cut 2 stars off.Reason for 3 Stars only:There are large and short mounting plates for those 4 arms included. The Beamer I use (7kg) Acer H9500BD has its 4 drillholes so close balanced in the center, that from this mount (you see the inner metal ring plate) even the shortest arms were too long. Turning them inside does not work as it would be too much in the center and I apparently got the luck to have the blind spot here. Anyhow it still works with 2 short plates reverse installed to the inside and 2 as you see on the picture. The outcome is an unbalanced montage. That would not be bad for a lightweight projector, but for mine it is.Now 2nd negative point that comes from this -&#62; There are 2 finger screws on a ball mount to arrange the picture on the wall and a small rubber plate inside to rise the contact. However, those 2 screws are metal on metal and you cant twist them much once they have contact. So with the short grip they have and my strongest pull my projector barely manages to not drift down on the heavier side. One cable weight more and it would slide off. ...the other problem would be similar like some might know from mounting a satelite dish stormproof. You see it's the same here. The screwholes are 1-2mm bigger than the screws and the steelframe is very hard to deform. Means you can screw as tight you want, the little air between the connecting tubes and the screwholes will make your calibration of the picture slobby. So the actual reducer of movement in this &#34;hole space&#34; is only the very low contact power between the tube and the mount, which is only not wobbling if you screw the bolts really tight. I guess some rubber ring could reduce this issue to a minimum.",2,Negative
"I would rate it a &#34;3&#34;.  It is a decent product requiring some redesigns.Pros:&#8226;Seems to be truly universal with tons of mounting options with screws included&#8226;Good baked on finish, should hold up to whatever you needCons:&#8226;The mount is hard to micro adjust, and there is something loose on a non-adjustable metal plate that you have to account for when readjusting the screen.  For example, once you have it aligned and try to tighten down the screws, a metal plate where the pole connects isn't completely secure and it sags down, so you have to overcompensate by moving the position even higher so it sags into place where you want it.&#8226;It also doesn't hold it's position over time, even using pliers on the screws and tighteners, it still requires readjustment about once every 1-2 months.",2,Negative
"Very angry I can't leave more stars. Simply impressive mount, with every possible installation covered. Pitched roof, no problem, longer no problem, tilt, swivel, weird angle, no problem. My install is behind a wall, though a hole (like movie theater). Very specific placement and not a lot of room for error. I was able to mount with the plate on a 90 degree angle on joist, and wallah, it worked fine. I have been selling and mounting projos for years, this is simply the best mount I've have ever used. Unparalleled flexibility and superb built quality. Oh and the price, really? Should be at minimum 5 times as much, and still would be a bargain.",2,Negative

This is a very sturdy bracket. Good for places where close to wall installation is needed. The only problem I had with this bracket is the difficulty in reaching the two screws that lock the bracket on the TV to the part fastened to the wall.,0,Negative

Some of the parts in this were not perfectly machined including two of the caster female thread assemblies.  We had to use two wrenches to get the wheels in properly.  Also when it is assembled it does not want to stand up perfectly straight but leans every so slightly to one side or the other.,2,Negative
"This was great for the price. I had to grind down a corner to plug in the hdmi cable, But that's the fault of the TV manufacturer.",1,Negative
"I had some doubts about this bracket, but it's working well.  Just make sure you get it into your studs, because depending on your TV, I doubt drywall anchors would hold.I also don't know what people are complaining about with regard to the VESA standard holes.  I had no problem with mine.",2,Negative
"This works well for my 32&#34; TV, definitely sturdy, but it only gets 3 stars because the clips for the wire guides are very weak and if you run something so heavy as a cat5 cable through it they fall out whenever you move the TV.",1,Negative
"After reading some reviews for this product I was worried that the installation would be difficult and that the knob on the rear would be hard to reach/adjust.  Neither of these things are an issue, not just for me, but for anyone with thumbs and a grasp of the English language.  The mount comes with a compartmentalized bag with every variety of bolt for the back of the t.v., all are clearly labeled.  The wall bolts accommodate the surface to which the tv will be mounted.  If the mount is loose at some point of it's articulation it can be adjusted with the allen keys that come in the package.  Installation took about 15 minutes.",0,Negative

"Ordered this for a 2013 40"" Westinghouse LCD TV. Box arrives stating on the outside fit's up to 65"", open it up read the manual it states fit's up to 42"". Still okay with that seeing as my TV is only 40"". First thought is okay it look's to small to fit a 40"" TV, take mount and hold up to back of TV where the mounting screw holes are. Only to find out it's to small and wont fit! So I did some research and if you type in the UPC code(812887014021) that they send you you'll come to find out that this mount only covers up to a 37""!!! This information is -*NOT*- on JLabs own website, but countless other's that aren't Amazon!!! Now they will argue with you that the standard on V.ideo E.lectronics S.tandards A.ssociation has changed since the making of this mount, and the fault is all MINE as the basic consumer. I get that information is changing so fast it's hard to keep up with. My only problem with this is that me as a basic consumer, rely on JLab to keep their product description and information current and relative to today's standard's set by V.E.S.A. If your going to advertise a product to fit 17 to 65 inch TV's make sure it does. Especially if your going to continue to sell it knowing full well that by today's standard's it doesn't. or else you'll end up getting customer's like me who had no clue what a V.E.S.A. mount for my TV is, and how to find it. Only once reading the three one star reviews did I find that this particular mount wont fit my brand of TV. The mount I have no problem with it seem's strong, reliable, and well built. It's the lack of clarification, lack of up to date product description, and lack of basic consumer understanding, that I have a problem with.",0,Negative
"This arm is sturdy, but it really has only one range of motion, side to side.  The up/down tilt angle isn't really adjustable.  You set it once & tighten it down with a difficult to reach plastic hand-knob - there is no option to use a wrench or pliers because the housing is too tight to fit any kind of tool in there.  You won't be able to change the tilt after you get the weight of a TV on it - NO WAY.",0,Negative

"I bought a 40 inch tv from amazon wanted to mount it in my bedroom.  The price seemed great so I got one.  The directions were ok but really it is three pieces of metal, you are not building a robot.

All I did was find the studs in the wall screwed the mount to the wall.  mounted the cross pieces to the tv put the tv on the wall mount and screwed the set screws in. If I mount a tv in the garage I will buy another.",0,Negative
"Instructions are horrible! There are no mention of the retaining plate (bar) that slides into the back grove that holds the shelf in place. Simple enough to figure out I guess, and that you just start these two screws into it then slide into back grove. You also will need to pre-drill for mounting screws that go into wall stud. I used a 5/32 drill bit but you may find it still too small. Mounting screws may still strip out since they are of low quality. Final results are just fine and would have rated higher, however then you might not have read this review that may be helpful.",0,Negative
The shelf itself was exactly what I needed.  The shelf was solid along with the mount but the bracket the shelf sat on was could have been made a little better.  The only problem that I had was that the bracket the shelf attacked to wasn't affixed to the glass so it came off.  Have a replacement being shipped out.  Will update if the replacement if bad.,3,Negative
My wife installed this and ended up stripping one of the screws that anchor it to the wall.  She had no other problems putting it together other than that.  I then placed a 4 channel DVR and a 15&#34; Dell monitor on it and it held up well and felt very sturdy.  It wasn't until I was adding wire ties to the cable when I put too much pressure on the front of it and the glue came loose from the back mount on the bottom side of the glass.  I'll be having to re-glue that now.,2,Negative
"The Cheetah Mount I used previously uses single horizontal brackets that make the whole mount stronger than the split horizontal brackets of this product. As such, when I mounted this off to one side from a couple of vertical studs, my TV pulled down a bit on the hanging side.

"it seems that articulated arms are either cheap, or very expensive.This is cheap.. its not great..a) the main support vertical can ""lean"" towards the weightb) you cannot adjust the friction of the elbows. They are STIFF, so it tends to rotate around the main vertical supportc) the degree of tilt at the monitor is inadequate.. and the connectory slide in bit to the monitor is loose fitting so the monitor sags down..d) raising or lowering the monitor is a risky proposition.. it goes from held stationary to freefall in and instant.. even when prepared and holding the weight the monitor will drop..so be careful with whats underneath.but.. its cheap..So buy if :a) you don't want to move the monitor a lotANDb) you don't want the monitor to tilt upif either of the above is a requirement, suggest you try elsewhere",2,Negative
"I have the Apple Airport Express as a wi-fi extender and bought this bracket to mount it on the side of a end table.  It's small footprint fits neatly right under the top overhand of the table.

Absolutely no problems with it staying adhered to the wood table.",3,Negative
"This thing does NOT support any weight. The base is made of glass, and as soon as I placed my (25lb) TV on the mount, it immediately shattered into dozens of tiny little shards. I cannot imagine how this stand could hold even the lightest 37&#34; television on the market.But, hey, maybe my TV defies the laws of physics and a hollow piece of metal stuck in a glass base can actually hold weight. If you want to gamble, go for it. Spend $88 and then vaccum the glass off your floor.",2,Negative
I haven't wall mounted it yet but the stand is great for our 125 pound 55 inch television.  It's very sturdy but the mount does block access to some of our ports which can be irritating.,3,Negative
"I used two bolts to mount this in a wall stud, it comes with a number of screws and bolts. These are adequate for mounting the back plate on a number of different sized applications. The plastic covers that server to hide the rear portion don't fit well together. This isn't a big deal to me.There is a single bolt that holds the inclination adjustment; this doesn't line up exactly and thus the mounted device can be tiled to the right or the left. I'm not sure if this is how it's meant to be or if it's a design flaw, however it is helpful if you didn't get the wall mount exactly horizontal.I do not trust this thing but it will fully extend. I have a vizio 40m weighing in at 30Lbs. it's seems a bit of a chore to adjust anything. I would recommend getting a couple of wall protectors for this. if you push it in it will touch the wall on the right and the left.I made the mistake of mounting mine up side down. Since the thing is symmetrical and there is essentially ( bidirectional tilt adjustments) this doesn't really matter. IT would have helped to have two people to do this job. I had a difficult time trusting the bar white it was extended.I did not follow the directions... I mounted the back plate, removed the swivel nut and set the U-Bracket on the single rail to put it back together since I was alone. There was a bit of urgency in doing this and getting the nylon washers back between everything was a little taxing but I had no help doing this.Make sure you hit a stud!! There's plenty of right and left adjust-ability. it can go about 18 inches in either direction. This fit the 200mm mounts perfectly. My TV already had mounting screws so I used those. The box came with anchors. These are for CONCRETE WALLS ONLY! Don't use them thinking that they're for drywall. They aren't! I would recommend a 1/8 or 3/16 inch drill bit and a 1/2 wrench to have handy. The included wrench works but it doesn't favour the ergonomics necessary to tighten the bolts into a stud.This unit doesn't creak or groan when adjusting it. The only bad part seems to be the tilting to the right or left ( this is a bitter sweet feature remedied with tightening the screw on the tilt adjustment ) and the dubious plastic covers for the wall bracket. I wouldn't dare mount anything heavier than 35Lbs on this, it just doesn't like to be adjusted and moving anything will cause stress on the parts. I can bump into my TV and it will wobble around a little but I can't exactly say this is a bad thing, on the included table top stand, it would wobble quite a bit more, so it seems more secure on the wall with this mount than it did on my dresser.I wouldn't use this if you expect to make a frequent adjustments; it does what it's intended to do however.",2,Negative

"This works for our purpose.  60&#34; Flat screen on a stand in a cut out above the fireplace.  It is NOT high quality.  The top was broken off of the base when it arrived (it's attached by a tiny piece of melted plastic, so it's no wonder it was broken).  It is still functional and swivels just fine with the TV on it.  No wobbling, no tilting, so not worried about the TV falling out.Overall, the best part of this product is the box it came in.  I got a good 20 minutes of entertainment from the extremely poor translations on the outside of the box.",3,Negative
"It does indeed work very well. It swivels quite smoothly, and the compact size allows more rotation than other models. Quite the improvement over the last swivel stand I had.But the packaging on the box HAS to be fixed! The grammar is horrible to the point of laughable.

"It's holding up well.  Bought this a few months ago.The only issue I have is that the TV leans a bit to the side when on a pivot.  I wish the brackets were more sturdy where they connect to the television.  It's not going to move from the wall, but I still worry about the metal that connects to the TV.",2,Negative
"The unit looks a little thinner than other units I have, but I put plenty of weight on it and it didn't break.  The tilt is not as good as the &#34;good&#34; units as this one has a screw you have to loosen to tilt it so once it's tilted to a position, it's staying there.  I needed this for a small 32&#34; TV that has the bolts so far apart, that a standard 32&#34; unit would not work on it (old LCD or Plasma TV - heavy).  I might not buy for a heavy TV that is expensive, but for a small/light/inexpensive TV, it's good.  I have some Barken units and they are sturdier/thicker.  But not by that much but if I have something expensive, it might be worth the extra insurance.",2,Negative
"Last time I checked, studs in the US is really only 1.5&#34; wide. This mount has holes that are 1.5&#34; apart though not on center.

"I purchased this unit and have 2 major issues:1. Most importantly, while it holds my TV, there is considerable sagging of the unit, which throws off the dimensions. I have a 55&#34; LED. This wall mount claims to hold up to 56&#34;, but if it's sagging badly at 55&#34; and LED, then you can forget about Plasma. Also, considering there appears to be this much strain on the unit to hold my TV, I was not comfortable with it and ended up returning this product. My assumption is 42&#34; and under would see significantly less strain on the unit, and even 42&#34; may be too large (especially a plasma).2. The directions are wrong. Not that's it hard to figure out, but the directions appear to be written for another product. Why do I say that? The directions and picture indicate there are 2 wall mounting screws, when in reality you need to screw in 4. Not a huge deal, but not a confidence builder for this product.Final summation: More or less solid build and good metal, but should not use for larger TV's.",2,Negative
I bought this for a trade show.  It easily holds my 37 inch Vizio LCD display.  It is very heavy duty.  My only minor complaint is that the head tends to droop a little if not tightened really well.  I suspect that this is due to the weight of my display and would probably not be an issue for most users with a smaller monitor.  Therefore I rated it a full 5 stars based on it's advertised limits.,2,Negative
"This thing is sweet! Really high quality parts/hardware.I have a 47&#34; Panasonic LED tv sitting on it and it does not budge. Everything is pre assembled and all you have to do is mount the bracket to the tv. I did get a vesa adapter because my tv was so big (type &#34;vesa adapter&#34; and it's the one with the 4 brackets). As long as you are under the specified weight limit, you should be okay. The base, when fully extended, is almost as wide as the tv so no worries at all.",0,Negative
Installation was very simple - drill two holes and then attach.  The joints are tight so that is both good and bad - it's good because the mount is less susceptible to sagging or dipping with the weight of the TV.  It's bad because it makes it tougher to adjust.,2,Negative
I had to mount this device on a wall to hold a 20&#34; flat screen.  Instructions were clear and easy to follow.  The only hard part is finding a stud to anchor this thing to.  I misplaced my stud finder and tried to 'wing it'  After a couple failed attempts I have suspended this project until I find my stud finder.,1,Negative
"I really was hoping this antenna would work but not even one channel would come in. We have a hunting cabin out in the woods where there is no possibility for cable. There is also no wired electricity, but we do have a gas powered generator for lighting and other necessities. We have a 32 inch HDTV hooked up with a built in DVD player that we use to watch movies. Since cable or a satellite dish is not an option, I thought the Mohu Sky HDTV Antenna was going to allow us to get at least the local channels. Wishful thinking I guess, because after spending over an hour of trying different spots on the roof, we got nothing but snow/noise. Not even a slight image came in. I made sure all the connections were tight and the signal amplifier and cables were connected as instructed. We even tried plugging the the power plug to the generator and using the USB port on the TV to see if that made a difference. The TV kept trying to scan for channels but the same message kept popping up ""no signal found"". I think I must of ran the scan the air/antenna channels at least 20 times!Maybe it is the television because I am really shocked that I was not able to get not even one channel. Even without the Mohu Sky Antenna hooked up there is absolutely no reception. Is it because the cabin is located in a heavily wooded area? I guess it is back to watching DVD movies.EDIT 05/02/13: I think I received a dud. I really found it hard to believe that I did not receive even one station/channel when I hooked it up in our cabin after reading all the great reviews others had written. I decided to try it on a television at home where we do have Time Warner Cable. My husband placed the antenna on our roof and sadly I still got nothing! No stations, no images, no sound...nothing. I believe I received a defective unit.",3,Negative
"I tried this antenna (rated for 60 miles) and then a highly rated RCA antenna (rated for 40 miles).  Neither brought in a single station at our home in the Poconos, despite the fact that several towers are within 35 miles and our analog antenna brought in quite a few.  Very disappointing since we wanted to cut the cord to save money.  I had to return them both.",3,Negative
"I can give only a limited assessment of the basic _performance_ of this antenna because the rainy season ended early, and any true assessment needs to include bad weather (not just ""rain fade"" but effects induced by winds). Instead this review will focus on other aspects of the product.In considering this product, remember to factor in installation costs, both mounting the antenna and running the cable to your TV(s). After factoring in installation, a pricey, small, light-weight antenna may be cheaper than the alternatives. Or not. YMMV. Or it may allow installation in a location that provides superior reception.For _me_, the advantages overwhelmed the problems noted below, and hence my rating.----My situation:Most of broadcast antennas for the local TV stations are in two clusters 25-30 miles from me in the same direction, but some stations are in an antenna farm 120 degrees from that (based on AntennaWeb.org). All except one of the latter are in the ""Yellow"" zone (least demanding), and the exception is listed in the ""Red"" zone (4th tier) but behaves like all the other Yellows. However, my reception conditions are complicated by my neighborhood's many mature trees, oaks and similar, which are 50-60 feet, some taller.My previous antenna is a very old (30 years) traditional rooftop antenna (LPDA) about 10 feet above my 15-foot high roof (single story home). With recent growth of nearby trees, I am now losing reception on some channels during rainy periods, but have been deferring the difficult task of relocating a large antenna because those rainy periods have recently been few and the Internet provided a more than adequate alternative. Because the new antenna required a separate installation (below), I left the previous antenna temporarily in place for comparisons.----Warning: Do NOT expect to be able to using an existing rooftop antenna mast to mount this. (1) The typical rooftop mast has a diameter of 1.5 inches, and this uses a 1-inch mounting pipe. (2) This antenna cannot be mounted in the middle of a mast -- it _must_ be mounted at the very top of the mast/mounting pipe because the groove for the mast stops after a few inches (see the picture).Note: This mounting bracket is commonly used by satellite TV dishes and if you have an unused one installed, you _may_ be able to replace the dish with this antenna (also reusing its coax cable). Unfortunately, satellite antennas are often in a horrible location for terrestrial broadcasts.----Warning: The mounting bracket is ill-suited for what I would think would be the most common location: At the end of a peaked roof. If you look closely at the manufacturer's picture on the box of this mounted such a location, you will notice that that peak is different from the others in that it has a larger endcap for the mounting. Not a problem for me, it could be for others. In most cases, the change is trivial if you have basic skills and tools (cut a small piece of plywood to shape and paint it).Note: This same mounting bracket and tube is also used by several other manufacturers of small antennas.----Deficiency: The cable provided is 30 feet of RG-59 coax. RG-59 is intended only for short runs, such as between components (DVD player and the TV). For longer runs, such as from antennas, RG-6 cable is called for because it has lower signal loss. RG-59 gets used because it is cheaper, but also because it is more flexible (smaller diameter, less shielding) but that flexibility can be a problem because too sharp bends degrade the signal (I have forgotten the parameters). In planning your installation, measure the _actual_ route of the cable -- you may well find that 30 feet is not that long.----Antenna orientation: No advice from manufacturerBeing an multi-directional antenna does _not_ mean that it provides equally strong reception in all directions: Every antenna has lobes. Experimenting with what is the best orientation has been been baffling, with me getting different results for stations broadcast from the same antenna cluster (but with a range of RF channels*: 7, 12, 19, 29, 30, 38, 44, 45). I used the strength meter in my TV tuner. To get signal strengths down to where I could see changes, I temporarily lowered the height of the antenna (introducing unavoidable confounding factors). For some stations, the variability as a I rotated the antenna was no different from the variability seen while the antenna was stationary. For seemingly similar stations, there was a 20-40% difference. Perplexingly, sometimes the stronger signal was with the long edge pointing at the broadcast antenna (as in a LPDA antenna) and sometimes it was with being perpendicular.This suggests that the product integrates multiple basic types of antennas. This is not only unsurprising, but what I would expect from an antenna in this price range. However, I was surprised that seemingly minor/invisible differences made significant impact on best orientation. You may want to put the antenna in a location where you can experiment to see if some orientation is better before doing a permanent installation (which often tend to be in hard-to-access locations).Remember: Antennas are usually installed during good weather but reception problems are most likely to manifest themselves during bad weather.----Performance:In good weather (the only type I have had since getting this antenna), its performance matches or exceeds my previous antenna. During my initial testing with the antenna in a window facing the primary broadcast antenna cluster, it provided roughly the same reception (by the tuner's strength meter) as my rooftop antenna.Aside: This is advertised as being suitable for installation in an attic. Be aware that installation in an attic dramatically reduces an antenna's reception. The rule of thumb is that one rated to receive station up to 60 miles, such as this antenna advertises, should be reduced to 20 miles. Part of this is that various roofing materials, especially asphalt shingles, hold moisture long after the actual rain has passed and that residual moisture can absorb significant signal strength before it reaches the antenna. If outdoor installation is precluded, don't _assume_ that this will be offset by the (small) height advantage of attic installation over being in a room on the floor below -- experiment. Recognize that wall also have many YMMV factors (construction and types of insulation and vapor barrier). In this situation and depending on these many YMMV factors, you might find an in-room antenna such asLeaf Ultimate, or similar, is preferable over an attic installation. But high and outside is the default for good reason.----Instructions:The parts come in bags labeled with letters that match up to the instructions, eliminating any confusion about what to use. The instructions themselves are generally well-done, although there is some potential for miscues. Since the small size of this antenna encourages installation by DIYers with no previous experience, I included my quibbles and disagreements as an Appendix to this review.Additional tools for assembly (excludes mounting): small Philips screwdriver, adjustable wrench----Lightning threat and building codes:The product literature describes this antenna as ""lightning resistant"" but gives no details. The typical building code requires a grounding block near where the coax cable enters the building, but the provided cable implicitly discourages this. While people tend to think of the tradition rooftop antenna as similar to a lightning rod, my understanding is that part of the threat from lightning is the currents induced in the cable itself from nearby strikes. I am simply aware of the issue, but lack the expertise to assess the risks.----Design:Power injector box: Power for the amplifier inside the antenna is carried to it over the coax cable from this box that is located near the TV. This box is powered by USB (see the manufacturer's description) using standard, readily available parts : USB 2.0 A to Mini-B Cable and a USB Wall-plug Adapter (what the manufacturer calls the ""power cube""). This makes replacement quick, easily and inexpensive should the need arise.The curves of the antenna seem to encourage water to run toward the coax cable connector. The seating for the weather-proofing boot is different from what I normally see: The lip is positioned on an insignificant cylinder. That cylinder can serve two purposes: additional friction to hold the boot in place and a larger contact area to maintain the seal if the boot deteriorates with age. The former is not needed by this antenna because the mounting tube provides more than enough pressure to keep the boot from slipping. However, I don't know about enough about materials to know about the latter. If the antenna is easily accessible for routine (annual?) checks, no worry (my situation). If it's in a difficult location, I would think about how to better protect it.----Shipping Packaging:Screws and some of the other small parts come in very thin bags. The bag for the mounting screws was inadequate to the task and several screws poked holes in it and escaped. Fortunately, this hardware was in a cardboard compartment that segregated it and thereby prevented damage to the finish on the antenna.---- APPENDIX: Notes on disagreements and improvements for the instructions ----Step 1: Installing the base mounting bracket on the roof, eaves, ...: The illustration can easily lead to the installation of the base bracket rotated 90 degrees from intended. Look at step 2 to determine proper orientation.Step 2: The ""mounting tube"" (their term, more commonly called a ""mast"" for antenna installations) has a bend at about 30% of its length. This allows the antenna to be positioned close-and-taller or further out and not as high. The installer should be alert to this option.Step 3: Attaching the coax cable to the antenna at this point might appear to be deferrable until later. However, attaching the antenna to the mounting tube (mast) in Step 5 is crucial to locking the weather-proofing boot in place (and I couldn't move the boot in position after the mounting had been tightened).Step 4: Attaching the bracket to the antenna. This could and should be done before Step 3. The instruction to ""loosely attach the nuts"" is an understatement -- the nuts need to be very loose to leave enough room to insert the mounting tube. The antenna is symmetrical and there are plenty of visual clues that it doesn't matter which side the bracket is mounted on, but this could well be mentioned in the written instructions.Step 5: Attach the antenna to the mounting tube (mast): Needs a reminder to check that the weather-proofing boot on the coax cable is properly seated -- it may well have come unseated during this process.Step 6: Run the coax cable from the antenna to your TV. I would argue that this should be done before Step 3 (attaching the coax to the antenna). Typically attaching the cable to the antenna is the _last_ step of the installation because repairing damage done by a jerk on the cable can be difficult or impossible to repair (I haven't disassembled this antenna to see how repairable it is). If you are going to attach the cable to the antenna earlier, you need to provide significant strain-relief and/or tie-down, which you will also need as part of the permanent installation (not documented). But if you have that installed, it will hold that end of the cable in position, so why not be reasonably paranoid and defer connecting the cable until the very end?---- Footnotes* Before the Digital TV transition, the RF channel number was the TV station's channel number, but with the transition many stations moved to different RF channels but kept the old number as a virtual channel number (to avoid confusion). For example, the station 02-1 in my area is now broadcast on RF channel 44.-- Douglas B. Moran",3,Negative
"I tried it, but didn't see  big improvement over the one I currently use.  I have an RCA ant751r.  Works fine.  So I returned this unit",3,Negative
"The Mohu Sky seems like a well-constructed product, however, the actual operation of the antenna is mediocre at best. Whenever there is any kind of wind in our area this thing breaks up so bad that I would rather turn my TV off because it just annoys the hell out of me. We live in Seattle about 15 miles at most from various TV towers and at best I am picking up about 20 channels. Which for the most part I am okay with, but the breaking up of channels while I watch something, I do not understand this. I would not recommend this antenna and would suggest people look elsewhere. There has got to be something better than this for the price. If you want an antenna that will give you a hell of a headache, then this is the one!",3,Negative
"esta antena es pr&aacute;cticamente para ciudad no para campo o sitios con arboles asi este muy alto la senal viene y se va. puede ser mejor. this antenna is virtually city sites, no for field or trees so that the very high signal comes and goes. it may be better.",2,Negative
"Do not use this if you live either A: near the maximum distance allowed for the antenna or B:  in an apartment complex (or near lots of tall buildings).  I'm sure it probably would have worked better if I lived in a more open area, but for where I'm at it's nearly useless (we only picked up one watchable channel).",2,Negative
"Purchased a Refurbished unit. It pulled in less stations than the old rabbit ear antenna. It was definitely a unit that had been returned before and probably is defective since I received the same number of stations even after I disconnedted the antenna from the 30' long coax cable...the antenna appeared to be doing nothing. Yes, the lines were hooked-up as per the included drawings and the USB power was showing a green light. Returned it and am waiting for my refund.",3,Negative
"That's it. Easy to install, works for intended purpose and probably a few other purposes I can't think of. Included mini-stylus is a bonus, works, but is relatively useless as you might imagine.",4,Negative
The knobs holding the angle of the swing arm are not strong enough to do so. The broke within three days.,0,Negative
"Despite what the headline says, this does NOT fit 7 inch tablets. It doesn't fit the Nexus 7. And I waited too long so now I can't return it.",0,Negative
I use this with my ipad 2. I had a little difficulty putting together. I hung it on concrete block in the basement above my treadmill. Nice to have a little &#34;tv&#34; there.,3,Negative
This arm did the same as ones costing more than triple at 'big box' stores.  No complaints at all --- and the price was reasonable on this; whereas I thought the arms at the stores were overpriced.,4,Negative
"This mount is heavy, sturdy and extremely adjustable. I own many TV mounts. In my experience it is best to get a sturdy mount that can adjust up and down as well as sideways.  The small mounts can't do that. The smaller ones that do adjust look crooked and unprofessional when mounted. This mount has no negative aspects to it except it cost more.",2,Negative
"I had to return this item even though judging from the product description, this item should have worked with my stereo. I tried it on 2 different stereos with ipod docks, both of which provide a charge to a docked iphone/ipod, and yet, I couldn't ever get this device to power on. No hassle on the return though & I ended up going with a different product that met my needs.",0,Negative
"I tried to use this with a product _made_ by Pyle-- a vertical sound bar-- and an iPhone 4s. Fail! It hooked up once, the second time I tried it, and played for hours. I haven't, however been able to get it to do it again since. It shows a connection, but plays no sound. Because it worked the once, I missed my window for return.",2,Negative
"It doesn't get any better than this mount as far as I'm concerned, from the built-in level to the ease of installation. Comes with enough mounting hardware I believe you'd be hard pressed to find a TV or location you couldn't mount to.",4,Negative
"The mount itself is great.  I have a 39&#34; LED-based HDTV mounted on it (40lbs), and it doesn't droop.  However, the supplied bolts for concrete or stud mounting are a cause for concern.  The bolts are extremely long and big, bigger than the standard six-sided drivers that come with American drill bit sets.  I had to use a Japanese drill bit set that included a huge adapter that would fit the head of the bolt.  However, the bolts themselves are made of very cheap metal that shears and breaks under pressure.  If the instructions are followed, the bolts will shear in normal wooden wall studs.  The guide hole made using the recommended size drill bit is too small and does not give enough guidance/relief to the weak bolts, which will shear and break.  Since the bolts snap in the middle, there's no way you can bolt in the wall mount.  After two bolts snapping, I went with bigger guide holes to relieve the friction on the lag bolts.  The mount itself is solid and great, but if you can't mount it to the wall, then it serves no purpose.  It's unfortunate that the company decided to cut corners on the crucial components.",0,Negative
"I had my TV previously on my dresser and this has really made the room look so much more sleek with the TV on the wall. I am single (now) so being able to do this project alone was very nice. Installation from box opening to TV being on the wall was around 30 min. It comes with whatever you need no matter which VERSA you have, and has minimal impact on your wall compared to mounts I've had in the past. For the price and ease of use, you cannot get better than this in my experience, and I've had 5-6 mounts over the years. The designs keep getting better and better!",0,Negative
"OOPS! Ierroniously said this pivots; ERROR! THAT was mount #1 in the basement. THIS IS STATIONARY and 100% simpler than two others I've mounted.The OmniMount requires little: Locate your stud, drill starter holes, ratchet in this two bolt circular base and simply place the TV on the back (your set will have a pair of metal rods that clamp into the holder. Need to remove it? A simple pull0-string releases it. EASY! USE THAT LEVEL to keep it even; ours looked off but was right-on. Avoid arguments, trust me.Too many screws and bolts is always better thasn not enough. You'll add (included) two feet that space the bottom from the wall. Easy.TODAY WE SWITCHD TVs! From a 32"" to a 50"", moved it all to another wall. Total time, 15 minutes. Cables are there, but banded for now.Have no fear.",0,Negative
"Summary- This mount is quality. Its made out of heavy steel and once its mounted you'll have no fear of it falling. Installation is a bit cumbersome and you will want to have 2 people to install it ideally. The one critique I have of this is that it does not allow you to go a full 90 degrees left and right if you need it. Otherwise, its a quality product that will last a lifetime, and somewhat flexible as far as allowing you to mount the tv where your studs arePros -Quality product made of heavy steelVery adjustable, can adjust height, pivot, tilt etcCons-Does not allow for full 90 degree rotationtakes two to installa little expensive for what you get",2,Negative
"This is a great stand except that it is extremely difficult to travel with and the instructions for assembly are WORTHLESS.  Everything is screwed together, so you basically need to disassemble it for travel.",1,Negative

"the shelf looks nice its somewhat small but still does the job but maybe its just my luck, but mine was manufactured bad, the glass did not line up with the screw hole to hold it in place, so i have a shelf with glass that just sits, its nice and all it just sucks that mine was messed up. either way its still a decent shelf",0,Negative
"This shelf is easy to install and performs as expected.  The shelves seem sturdy enough but will wobble from side to side.  However, there is no danger of the shelves coming loose or the components falling off.  I had difficulty hiding the cords and gave up on it.",2,Negative
"It hangs a flat screen tv....what can I say, this does exactly what it claims to do...hang flat screens up to the weight it specifies.  Installation procedures are just like any other flat wall mounts.  Those pull tabs mechanisms are a pain when hanging a 50 to 60 inch as they click to lock position because it's easy to accidentally knock them in.",0,Negative
"It is good, but the plastic strip is broken in mounting.",1,Negative
I've got three of these things and they do what they are supposed to.  Two are holding up 60 inch tvs and one is holding a 32.  My only problem with it is the blue pull tabs are hard to hide on the 32&#34; tv.,0,Negative
"I was about to spend several hundred dollars on another brand when the opportunity to review the OmniMount came to me.  I admit, that I was skeptical, and a bit fearful of putting my 55&#34; Sony XBR on a mount I hadn't even considered.  It's hard enought to trust a mount costing a few  hundered dollars more than this mount with a TV costing over $3K. I decided if the mount wasn't a great option for the expensive TV, it would be relgated to the garage TV.I am glad I took the risk.  This is an extremely sturdy mount.  Once I unboxed it my fears began to subside. Once it was on the wall and I pulled, tugged, twisted, and stressed it I was very confidedent it would keep my TV safe!With a level, a screw gun, a stud finder, and a little pre-planning the mount was up in minutes, tested a few minutes after that, and the Sony was hanging on the wall for the first time ever, just a few minutes after that!I have forgotten all the reasons I wanted the much more expensive mount now, and will be purchasing an OminiMount for the 70 or 80 in TV that is coming soon to a room in my house!",0,Negative
